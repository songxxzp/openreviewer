Furthermore, to improve the identifiability of the classifiers and the workers, the authors also proposed two variants of the CCEM by introducing two different regularization terms. Experimental results on several synthetic and real-world datasets show corroborate the theoretical claims and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

The design and technique details of the software structure are disclosed and reproducible. In addition, the theoretical analysis presented in this paper is conducive to research on the CCEM criterion.\n\nThere are several issues:\n- The experimental results in Table 1 are somewhat weak, and the authors should discuss the results in more detail, e.g. the performance of Max-MIG is competitive in most cases, and in case 1, GeoCrowdNet(W) does not show the advantages well compared with GeoCrowdNet(F) though the N is small and M is relatively large.\n- Whether there is an appropriate strategy or method to make decisions about which variant (GeoCrowdNet(W) or GeoCrowdNet(F)) should be used on a specific dataset?\n\n",

The newly designed regularization terms based on the relaxed assumption consider 1) when the annotation data is large (voting matrix is not sparse), no expert/dominate is also ok, can set the classifier-related regularization terms; 2) when there are more annotators, can set the voting matrix as regularzation term. This paper transfers an intuitive impression \"the more annotators/annotations and the stronger classifiers, the better the performance of the crowdsourcing task\" in a mathematical way.\n\nWeakness/problems: \n- The author should provide a more detailed analysis of how and when to select the regularization term, with varying N and M. Table 1 has only 6 combinations, it's really hard to make an accurate conclusion of how to choose the regularization term.  \n - When N and M are large, are the performances of GeoCrowdNet(M) and GeoCrowdNet(F) come close to majority voting? Does it still works when the voting marix is sparse?\n - In Table 1, case 2, N = 5000, why TraceReg perform much worse than GeoCrowdNet(\u03bb = 0)? TraceReg has trace constraints compared with GeoCrowdNet(\u03bb = 0).\n",
