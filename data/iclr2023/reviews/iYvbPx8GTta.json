            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors focus on the seeded graph matching problem, which is a variant of the graph matching problem with several pre-matched pairs as initial seeds. In existing works, the seeds are hardly considered especially in supervised graph matching works. They propose to apply the GNN jointly over both the two input graphs for matching and try to learn the pair-wise similarities. Specifically, their proposed SeedGNN contains two modules: the convolution part for learning the witnesses to distinguish the true pairs and the fake pairs; the percolation part for filtering the prediction of the model and generating the new seeds by matched node pairs. Experiments are conducted on multiple datasets to verify the performance of the proposed SeedGNN with the comparison of various baselines including both semi-supervised learning and supervised learning.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:**\n1. This paper focuses on the seeded graph matching problem, which is hardly considered in the literature, especially for existing deep graph matching works. Indeed, initial seeds can make models better handle graphs with a large number of nodes. Therefore, I think it's necessary and interesting to consider the seeded graph matching problem.\n2. The authors propose a new architecture called SeedGNN consisting of two main components namely the convolution module and the percolation module, which can better handle the seeds and generate more new seeds.\n\n**Weakness:**\n1. The authors claim, \"In contrast to previous approaches that apply GNNs separately to each graph, a key departure of our SeedGNN architecture is to apply the GNN jointly over two graphs and to learn a pair-wise similarity for each pair of nodes directly.\" While in the field of deep graph matching, similar approaches already exist, such as the SOTA BBGM[1] and NGM[2]. These methods utilize the single affinity matrix constructed from the two input graphs as the input to their GNN. So, what is the main difference between the proposed SeedGNN and existing deep graph matching works? \n2. As for the comparison of SeedGNN and existing deep graph matching works, I agree that existing deep graph matching works hardly consider utilizing the initial seeds, but I think it is too absolutely to claim that the \"node-based GNN approach faces significant difficulty in learning how to use seed information\". For example, we can set the initial seeds as matched pairs and let the methods learn the other nodes, or we can modify node/edge affinities in the affinity matrix based on the matching seeds, or we can remove the initial seeds from the input graph to generate a smaller graph and let the methods work on the new graph. Anyway, I think there are many straightforward approaches to allow existing deep graph matching methods to use the same seed information as the SeedGNN, and it is arbitrary to make such a judgment in this paper. \n3. For the results in Table 1, I hope the authors may consider my suggestion above and make a more fair comparison. I think the current results in Table 1 look weird that the results of all supervised methods (including SOTA methods in graph matching) are zeros. Making the supervised methods use the same seed information will be better.\n4. The authors claim the proposed SeedGNN can automatically choose the effective features many times in the paper, but the proof looks not sufficient enough to me. The authors only prove it in the experiments: \"From theoretical graph matching results, we have learned that we need to use witnesses at different numbers of hops for matching sparse graphs (p = 0.01) and dense graphs (p = 0.2). Thus, these results suggest that our SeedGNN can adaptively choose the appropriate features to match different types of graphs.\" While I do not think it can demonstrate the claim. Moreover, I think this claim should be demonstrated in theory, since the good performance in the experiments may have multiple reasons instead of the reason for choosing the right features claimed by the authors.\n5. For the masking part of the proposed SeedGNN, the authors claim \"we leverage an approach called masking to remove the noisy information and retain the cleaner information.\"  However, I think this masking approach is very similar to one existing graph matching paper in ICLR 2020 (Eq 17 of [3]), which also uses Hungarian as a mask for the output. Could the authors please show the difference between their approach and the ICLR 2020 work?\n6. The proposed SeedGNN can generate new seeds by matched node pairs in the matching process, but I wonder if it will be troublesome when the newly generated seed is wrong by mistake. For example, if the generated seeds at the beginning of the matching process are wrong, would it damage the entire matching process? Maybe an error correction or regret mechanism should be considered.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Rol\u00ednek, Michal, et al. \"Deep graph matching via blackbox differentiation of combinatorial solvers.\" European Conference on Computer Vision.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "In my view, the novelty of this work is unquestionable since the seeded graph matching problem is hardly considered in the literature. But the clarity and quality of the work are not so satisfactory due to the weakness I find. As for reproducibility, I can not make a judgment since the authors do not plan to open-source their code.\n",

However, except for this point, the other parts of this paper look not good enough to me. As I mentioned in the weakness part, the authors need to clarify the difference between several existing works to further demonstrate their contributions. Therefore, I consider this paper is not yet ready for publication in ICLR.\n",

The ideas behind each building block are not new, which have been used in previous graph matching algorithms.\n2. The main drawback of the framework is the high computational complexity. The complexity of the proposed model is essentially the same as a GNN model on a graph with $n_1n_2$ nodes and $m_1m_2$ edges. Thus the time and space complexity is $m_1m_2$ and $n_1n_2$  respectively for each layer. This is huge for moderate-size graphs.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a GNN for seeded graph matching. In the non-seeded version, the goal is to align/match the nodes between two graphs (eg. in social networks/ego networks, the same users appear across multiple networks.), while in the seeded version, there are a small number of pre-existing matching given. Most previous GNNs for seeded graph matching adopt a transductive semi-supervised setting, which  cannot learn transferable prior that is generalizable to unseen graphs. This paper proposes SeedGNN, which operates on a pair-level. There is first a convolution module to capture witnesses of seeds across different hops, and a percolation module to filter high-confidence pairs and use them as new seeds. SeedGNN is evaluated on both synthetic and real graphs.\n\n\n",

Despite the task differences, the model design might still be relevant and some ideas can be borrowed. At the minimum, a discussion on the model design should be included to highlight why previous inductive semi-supervised approaches cannot be adopted here.\n\n[1] Meta-Inductive Node Classification across Graphs  https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06725\n\nW2. The idea of using easily matched pairs as new seeds in the percolation layer is quite straightforward and used in other seeded problems, where a few initial seeds can bootstrap the process and high-confidence instances can be added as new seeds later.\n\nW3. The \"witness\" is an important concept. While i get the general idea at the high level, it is not clearly defined: what exactly are witnesses? Is there a precise definition?\n\nW4. In table 1, the supervised seedless models have very low accuracy (0-0.1%). But is such comparison meaningful? After all, the supervised methods are not designed for such seeded setting with very small supervision.
