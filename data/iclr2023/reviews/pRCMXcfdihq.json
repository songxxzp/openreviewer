            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an iterative method for protein sequence-structure co-design. In each generation step, the model first uses IPA network to update the 3D structure ($C_a$ coordinates and the orientation of its frame). It then predicts the amino acid types at all positions. The proposed method is applied to antibody CDR design (co-design) and protein design (fixed backbone and co-design) applications and showed state-of-the-art performance.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The proposed method improves upon the previous co-design method (Jin et al 2021) by generating all the amino acids in an iterative refinement process rather than left-to-right autoregressive process.\n2. The inference cost is lower than diffusion models which requires thousands of generation steps.\n\nWeakness:\n1. For protein design tasks, the term \"co-design\" is somewhat misleading. The method does not generate protein structure (and sequence) from scratch. It is conditioned on the contact map + secondary structure, which is a fuzzier representation of the backbone structure but it contains many information of the structure. The contact map needs to be taken from an existing structure, although it can be specified manually for certain types of structures.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The method description is quite clear.

The key idea is to involve the structure, sequence, and context together for encoding and decoding. The key modules are trigonometry-aware encoder and roto-translation equivariant decoder in a one-shot way. The experiments are conducted on three different tasks and the results show the ProtSeed is effective. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The paper works on the protein sequence and structure co-design task, which is important and hot recently. \n2. The method in this work is well-motivated and the modeling way is reasonable and solid. \n3. The results show strong improvements over previous works on different tasks. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Most of the paper writing is good. However, in some claims and places, they are not appropriate enough. The authors mainly claim that the specific antibody prediction method, e.g., RefineGNN, is not general and is in a specific domain. However, in my view, their method is general, but they only show the application in antibodies. Besides, the sequence, structure, and rotamers sequentially generation are slow as the authors claimed, but the inconsistent and fanciful proteins may not be the truth. A good sequence can help structure, and a good structure can also help sequence, iteratively update sequence and structure is hard to say a negative point or \"issue\" as the authors mentioned. \n2. From an overview of the technique, the trigonometry-aware encoder and the equivariant decoder are mostly taken from Alphafold2, though some modifications are taken. In terms of this, the novelty is hard to say as big as the authors claimed. Alphafold2 also worked on the protein (though they don't predict the sequences). \n3. There are some places in the method questionable. (a). On the decoder side, within the encoder output, the decoder continuously updates the context feature $m$ and $z$, where the interactions of the context amino acids are involved in the encoding way. However, the update of the amino acids that need to predict seems to be not so clear and reasonable. For example, the $z$ feature is only performed between the amino acids in the context, but no consideration between the predicted amino acids (if I understand correctly of $z$). (b) The description of SeqIPA is not well presented. Though in supplementary (please append this as Appendix after the main text instead of supplementary) the authors try to explain, but the formulation is not shown. When compared with the original IPA, it is still not clear how to calculate with the five different inputs. (c) In eqn. 7 and 8, why the MLP takes m(t+1) and m(0) rather than updated m(t+1)? Is $\\lambda$ necessary? Also more explanations may need for Algorithm 1. (d) In eqn.11, how $x_{ij}$ is calculated since in previous descriptions they are all based on the amino acid level instead of the atom level, this should be noted.  \n4. One disadvantage of this method is that they require the context of $m$ and $z$, amino acid and pair features. This somehow concerns me about the practice in real scenarios. The hard request of these two features may not be friendly for some tasks. For example, how to generate from a general distribution. The authors can provide more discussions. \n5. Though the decoding speed is much improved. I would like to also know more about the training cost, since the method is much more complex than previous ones. For example, small encoders are also involved in the decoder side. Besides, as for the experimental comparisons, since the compared baselines are provided by the authors, the code should be published (also the implemented baseline code). Also, the ablation study is not provided, it is hard to see the contribution of each part. ",

Current methods use either autoregressive or diffusion-based models, which the authors claim are computationally expensive and produce suboptimal solutions. Sequence generative models can produce good designs, but do not model protein structures. The authors address the above issue with their method ProtSeed. ProtSeed uses a triangular-aware encoder to learn geometrical constrain from context features and roto-translation equivariant decoder that iteratively improves protein structure followed by an MLP to decode the amino acid identities from the structure. The author performed experiments on the structural antibody database and 2 protein design benchmarks.",

A novel approach for solving the structure and sequence of protein and study for the de novo protein design\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Lack of specific hyperparameter and training details\n2. No mention that code and trained models will be released\n3. The application of the antibody CDR design task is clear, but the relevance of the other two tasks is murkier. When would detailed structural specifications be available, but without an existing sequence that forms that fold?\n4. The authors note a difference between their evaluation and the published scores for Diffusion, GNN and RABD models (Table 1). However, the concern remains that the Diffusion model shows significantly better RMSD scores compared to the scores in this paper. What is the source of this discrepancy?\n5. ProtSeed improves over previous methods in terms of PPL, RMSD, and AAR. However, because the task is to design functional proteins, these metrics may not reflect true model performance, because a model with higher RMSD may, in fact, produce (more) functional proteins while also being worse at predicting structure. It would be helpful to provide some additional, functional-oriented, evaluation. For example, by comparing the protein-protein interaction patterns and charge distributions between the designs and the ground truth.\n6. AAR is surprisingly low for all of these methods, including ProtSeed. If only 40% or less of amino acids are correctly recovered, how confident can we be that any of these methods actually produce good designs?\n7. I\u2019m not convinced by AF2 structure prediction as an evaluation. It isn\u2019t surprising that AF2 would predict the designed proteins to fold as intended, because all of these models are trained on the same PDB data and, therefore, probably have the similar pathologies.\n\nOther minor comments:\n1. Figure 4. \u2013 To keep a uniform style among all figures, a, b c marks could be moved outside of the figures as in Fig. 1-3\n2. Table 3 \u2013 highlight best results as in table 1 and 2\n",
