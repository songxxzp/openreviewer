            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the identifiability of the label noise transition matrix $T(X)$ for instance-dependent noises. By applying Kruskal's identifiability results to the label noise case, the authors have shown that three independent noisy labels for each instance are sufficient and necessary for identifying the transition matrix. Since three independent noisy labels could be a somewhat strong requirement, the paper has also discussed the identifiability of T(X) in the cases when $P(Y\\vert X)$ enjoys clustering properties or the representations of the feature are disentangled and informative.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strength\n- The paper provides a sufficient and necessary condition for learning with instance-dependent noise. Although the main theorem (Theorem 5) seems a direct application of Kruskal's identifiability results, to me, it is still an interesting and novel view for understanding the identifiability of the label noise learning problem.\n- Experiments are conducted to show that the disentangled features help identify the transition matrix.\n\n### Weaknesses\nMy main concern about the paper is the significance of the theorems presented in Section 5 and the clarity of the presentation.\n- about the significance: In Section 5, the authors attempt to show that the requirement on three independent noisy labels can be relaxed by considering the smoothness of clusterability of the features. But, I am confused by some parts of the statement, and it is unclear how the proposed theorems could relate to the goal of relaxing multiple noisy labels.\n\t- About Definition 5: Definition 5 introduces the 2-NN clustrability. It is unclear to me how the clustrability could help to reduce the requirement of multiple noisy labels. It seems that we still need two additional conditions to ensure the identifiability: (1) the 2-nearest neighbors (NN) of $X$ shares the same transition matrix with $X$. (2) the noisy label of X and its 2-NN should be independent. It is unclear how easy it is to meet these conditions in practice. It seems that these conditions are somewhat equal to the three independent noisy label requirements in the proposed example (see below).\n\t- About the example in Theorem 6: the authors prove Theorem 6 by showing that the same instance $X$ will appear three times, and thus $X$ is the 2-NN of itself. It is unclear to me how the condition on the independence of the noisy labels could be satisfied in such a case. If the independent condition is true, it seems that we still need three independent nosy labels for the same $X$.\n\n\t- About Theorem 8 and Theorem 9: At first glance, the theorem shows that we only need 1 noisy label to ensure the identifiability of $T(X)$ when the representations of X are disentangled and informative. But it is unclear to me what is role of the disentangled feature plays in the theorems. It seems that, by the Kruskal's identifiability results, one can directly show $P(Y\\vert X)$ is identifiable with the disentangled and informative representations only (please correct me if I am wrong). In such a case, there is no need to identify the noise transition matrix, which makes the requirement for disentangled and informative representations seem very strong.\n- about the clarity of presentation:\n\t- This paper has introduced many notations, which makes it hard to follow. To me, some of them are somewhat redundant. For example, the notation of $P_\\theta$ is seldomly used in the rest parts.\n\t- Section 3.1 has spent much space introducing the MPE problem. It is unclear how the MPE problem is related to the main focus of the paper presented in Section 4 and Section 5. I think it would be better for the authors to make this point clear.\n\n### Minor points:\n- It would be better to use \\citep instead of \\citet, if the cited paper does not appear as a component of the sentence.\n- Page 6: the third line of the proof sketch, there is an additional \".\" after $Y\\in\\\\{1,2,\\dots,K\\\\}$.\n- Page 6, first sentence in Section 5: focuses--> focus\n- Definition 5: since $Y$ is a random variable,I think it would be better to write the condition as $P(Y \\vert X) = P(Y_1 \\vert X) =P(Y_2 \\vert X)$ to avoid potential misunderstanding.\n- Figure 2:\"Grey\"--> \"Grey color\"\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity & quality: some parts of the paper are unclear (please see the weakness part above for more details).\n- Novelty: It is an interesting view to understand the identifiability of the noise transition matrix by using the Kruskal's identifiability results.\n- Reproducibility: the paper has provided the code and complete proofs for the theorems. \n",

My main concern about the paper is the significance of the theorems and the clarity of some statements. Overall, I think the flaws overweight the merits of this paper, and it falls into the borderline cases.\n\n===post-rebuttal===\nAfter reading the author's feedback and other reviews, I do find this paper has some interesting parts. But, as also mentioned by other reviewers, the clarity of this paper should be further improved, especially on the definition and the motivations of examples in Section 4.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n\n-Existing results on the identifiability of noise transition matrix mainly focus on the class-dependent instance-independent label noise. This paper considers this identifiability problem in the instance-dependent noise setting. They show that given three noisy labels the identifiability of an instance-dependent noise transition matrix can be guaranteed.\n\nCons:\n\n-**The most important definition is unclear.** In the definition of identifiability of transition matrix $T(x)$, only $\\theta(x)$ appears, it is not clear where the hidden variables $Y$ (unobserved) and $\\tilde{Y}$ (observed) are. It also seems that the notation $\\theta(X)$ is redundant, definition 2 can be explained directly using $P_{T(X)}$, as in $\\theta(X)=(T(X), P(Y\\mid X))$ the prior $P(Y\\mid X)$ is not really a parameter (adding this makes me very confused at first glance). What is the statistical model in definition 2, given the current definition I think it should be $P_{\\theta(x)}$, can we interpret it as a probability distribution over a probability? Then should definition 2 be put as $P_{\\theta(x)}$ is identifiable if $\\theta(x)\\neq\\theta\u2019(x)$, $P_{\\theta(x)}\\neq P_{\\theta\u2019(x)}$? Also, why the label permutation appears in definition 2? Due to this condition, the notion is not identifiability to me.\n\n-**The most important theorem is not rigorously proved.** In the identifiability condition (Theorem 5) proof for necessity, the authors **only prove the binary label noise case and directly drop the noise dependency on the instance**, but the paper claims a multi-class setting and the identifiability condition is both necessary and sufficient. At least this should be made clear in the main paper!! A natural question is can this necessity proof be extendable to the multi-class instance-dependent noise case?\n",

The paper would be stronger if this can be improved.\n\n-Novelty: the paper draws interesting connections between the identifiability of the transition matrix in label noise learning and Kruskal\u2019s identifiability results which is novel to me.\n\n-Reproducibility: good.",
