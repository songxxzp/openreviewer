I feel that this work focuses more on the construction of a spacetime graph instead of the representation learning (especially learning) on it.\n    2. The method is not presented clearly enough. It simply refers to several previous works and theories for many crucial steps in the proposed method, without enough explanations.\n    3.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies embedding of directed graphs into Lorentzian spacetimes.  The idea is very natural as such spacetimes have causal structure, and a pair of points can be embedded with timelike separation if there is an edge and spacelike if there is not.  It was proposed by Clough and Evans (2017) and studied by Sim et al (2021) and others.  The present work generalizes this in various ways: use spacetimes other than Minkowski which can have closed timelike curves and thus represent graphs with directed cycles, and exclude part of the future lightcone to represent nontransitive graphs.  Probably the most significant improvement over previous models is the use of a time separation function in the objective function to distinguish link orientations.  Several experiments are done to choose hyperparameters (spacetime topology, dimension, norm) and provide proof of principle.  It is found that a cylindrical Minkowski space is better than Minkowski space for low dimensional embeddings.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: ideas are simple and have some interest, presentation is relatively clear for a reader with a background in the relevant geometry.  Known results on spacetimes developed in the study of general relativity are brought into the discussion.\n\nWeaknesses: the results are incremental, especially compared to Sim et al (2021).  The new ideas are not explored in any depth.  The experiments do not go farther than proof of principle.  Comparison with other work outside of this very specific direction is weak, for example no mention is made of the very popular and standard methods for embedding directed graphs such as TransE (Bordes et al 2013).",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "This is a competent work which I found readable though not very well written.  Much of it seems to this reviewer like a direct sequel or follow-on to Sim et al (2021).  The most significant innovation I saw was the use of the time separation function in the objective function to distinguish link orientations.  It may be significant that this function breaks Lorentz invariance and singles out a preferred direction, much as is done in the TransE embedding of DAGs (Bordes et al 2013).  It would be interesting to understand the geometry behind this.\nIf this were the first paper in this direction, I would be more willing to accept it, but a follow-on paper should be more innovative, go into more depth, or both.",
