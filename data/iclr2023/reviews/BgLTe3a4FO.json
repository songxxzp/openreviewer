            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of correlation testing in the federated framework compatible with secure aggregation. They motivate the problem of correlation testing with several applications and also give a relevant hospitals based example for the federated setting. They propose an algorithm with two simple observations - calculating correlations is equivalent to calculating moments, and one can use stable random projections to calculate moments. They provide formal security guarantees, utility guarantees and calculations of communication and computation costs. Lastly, they conduct extensive experiments on real world and simulated datasets to illustrate the efficacy of their algorithm.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The writing is very clear.\n2. The problem is well motivated and the explanation of the model using an example makes the paper easy to understand.\n3. The experiments seem thorough and the evaluation is done on both real world and synthetic datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe idea of correlation can be calculated using moments is quite obvious and if one knows the random projections literature, the idea of using stable projections to calculate $p^{th}$ moments for $p \\leq 2$ is also standard. The paper claims to make headway into non-linear secure aggregation, but using random (linear) projections in secure aggregations is not new and extending it to stable projections is great, but not enough of a contribution in and of itself, in my opinion. \n\nThe experiments are extensive and thorough, but besides the experiments studying the effects of clients dropping out, the experiments provide little additional info since the empirical results are expected from the theoretical results and they just illustrate the accuracy of stable random projections.\n\nThings that did not impact my score:\n\nThe formal security proof and utility proofs are just corollaries of the results from previous papers, and could be stated as such instead of \"theorems\". The communication and computation costs can just be remarks since they are simple calculations.\n",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "S1. Paper proposes a method for doing federated correlation in a distributed setting\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper relies heavily on 2 separate works (one of which is quite recent). Work 1- is by Indyk et. al. for federated frequency moments estimation and Work 2 - is Bell et. al. Secure aggregation of frequency moments.  These two methods make the paper function as in paper can be summarized as composition of the two papers. Work 2 - can be replaced by any other scheme for secure aggregation. Both of these are left for readers to learn on their own! A novice reader could feel lost as math for simple stuff (like breaking of chi square into moments) is provided but the actual method (both federated computation of frequency moments) and secure aggregation are taken for granted. It would be greatly beneficial to community if authors could take the time (and pages left) to actually describe the methods in simple terms.\n2. Computations analysis seems to exclude the time required in actual secure aggregation. \n3. Paper lacks reproducibility statement \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Novelty is the least impressive part of paper. Authors had access to 2 separate methods and described a solution com-positioning them. While this is not a grounds for rejection - it weakens the contributions. Especially when both methods are not described in any detail.\n\nPaper will be hard to reproduce as methods used are not described but rather stub functions are used\n\nThe math behind the paper is not clear! The math mentioned in the paper captures simple concepts around breaking down of correlation tests into moments. The actual math entailing projection and then aggregation is missing.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Based on the work done in the paper, since there is missing math and explanation and the paper has weak experimentation and limited novelty its hard to accept.
