            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new deep model framework named Selective Frequency Network (SFN) for multiple image restoration tasks, including single image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, image motion deblurring, image desnowing and image deraining. SFN builds on two types of basic blocks, i.e., Multi-branch Dynamic Selective Frequency module (MDSF) and Multi-branch Compact Selective Frequency module (MCSF). MDSF is proposed to decompose the feature into frequency subbands dynamically and locally for accentuating the effective ones further, while MCSF is designed by using global and window-based average pooling to deal with the large-scale degradation kernel. The proposed SFN exploits a U-type structure to assemble the modules of MDSF and MCSF. Extensive experiments are carried out to validate the superiority of SFN and the effectiveness of block components MDSF and MCSF. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper pays attention to the large discrepancy of sharp and degraded image pairs in the frequency domain, and proposes the modules MDSF and MCSF which are used to build SFN net. It is novel in terms of method. The structure of the proposed SFN is clearly presented in the text, and more details are further discussed in Appendex A-H. The content of the paper is very sufficient. The proposed method is validated by extensive experiments to be effective on many image restoration tasks, and perform favorably compared with lots of SOTS methods on various datasets. In addition, ablation studies are made to explain the design of the modules MDSF and MCSF.\n\n1.What are the advantages of the \u201cShallow Layer and output layer\u201d over existing multi-scale methods? \n2.Why MDSF and MCSF are concatenated in Figure 1? These two modules are used independently, right?\n3.How to control the kernel size of different decouplers in MDSF? From figure 2(b), it\u2019s seems that all the kernel size are k^2?\n4. There are still some typos in the paper:\n(1) In the last paragraph of Section 2, both \u201cXu et al.\u201d and \u201cMao et al.\u201d lack reference numbers.\n(2) In Figure 2(b), the output of MDSF is the concatenation of the low-frequency feature and the high-frequency feature, while in Figure 2(c), MCSF receives two inputs, i.e., the low-frequency feature and the high-frequency feature from MDSF. I wonder if the concatenation operation in Figure 2(c) is necessary.\n(3) The parameter c in equations (2) and (4) takes a real value as in c \\in R^{C_i} and c\\in R^{2C}. However, c is the index of a channel according to the context of the paper, and could take an integer value.\n(4) Section 3.2.1 could be modified to Section 3.3.",

The experiments show that the proposed network achieves state-of-the-art results on five image restoration tasks. The supplementary material shows more results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It will be better if the authors can integrate and simplify Figures 1-3 properly. \n2. How to switch the high-pass and low-pass filters in the Filter Switcher automatically?\n3. More visual results or the corresponding PSNRs can be added in Figure 5 to show the superior of the proposed network. Besides, the typesetting of Figure 5 should be modified. If the space is limited, try to delete some compared results in Table1-7.\n4. Are the ablation studies all about the deblurring task? If so, add this explanation. \n5. The FLOPs should be added in Table 10 to support that more MCDF modules bring few parameters and complexities.\n",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "1) There are some problems in the proof of this paper. In Eq. 8 and Eq. 9, the author describe that the first row(diag(1,0,0,\u2026,0)) in the Fourier domain is low frequency and the others are high frequency. According to this description, for a feature of size CxHxW, low frequency is the mean value in the spatial dimension and the size of low frequency is Cx1x1, which can be seen in Section 3.2 and Appendix C. This description is contrary to the commonly used low frequency and high frequency. In practice, the size of low frequency and high frequency are CxHxW and low frequency occupies a large part of information and high frequency is only in the edge area. In the two-dimensional Fourier domain (the data has been processed by fftshift), we generally believe that the low frequency is the region within the radius R, and other regions are the high frequency [1-3]. Therefore, the Eq. 8 and Eq. 9 may not be consistent with the actual situation. In other words, the author only provided theoretical proof of MDSF for extreme low frequency, but did not provide theoretical proof of MDSF for other low frequency. More importantly, the author did not demonstrate that the low frequency in the MDSF meets Eq. 8. The low frequency in the MDSF is obtained through learning, not the mean value of the feature. In addition, the size of low frequency is CxHxW, which is completely inconsistent with the low frequency scale defined by the author. Therefore, this proof is problematic and the author confused the definition of low frequency.\n2) The author did not write clearly the experimental settings, such as the number of branch in MDSF, the number of group in MDSF.\n3) The experiment is not rigorous. In the ablation experiment, the number of epoch is inconsistent in the ablation experiments of different components. Authors should unify the number of epochs.\n4) There are some typos in Section 4.8 and Eq. 15.\n\n[1] Liming Jiang, Bo Dai, Wayne Wu, and Chen Change Loy.
