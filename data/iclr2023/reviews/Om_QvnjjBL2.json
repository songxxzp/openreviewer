            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper identifies a degenerated case of subgraph matching, in which it falls to subtree matching. Then, the matching procedure can be implemented by the built-in tree-structured aggregation mechanism on graph neural networks. The paper proposes a new deep learning method for approximate subgraph matching.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n- The proposed idea is novel.\n- The experimental results are strong.\n\nWeakness:\n- The writing of the paper should be improved.\n- Although the paper provides a complexity analysis, the paper should also provide a runtime analysis to compare with baseline approaches. Given that there is an extra operation of converting a graph to a subtree, I assume the proposed method is slower compared to other deep learning based approaches. However, this is not discussed in the paper.\n- Although I understand that this approach is proposed for approximate subgraph matching, I believe the paper should at least include some comparisons with exact subgraph matching methods. Please feel free to skip CO-based methods in settings where they are not applicable.\n- The paper is kind of overclaiming the theoretical contribution of the paper. The paper relaxes the sufficient and necessary conditions to that of necessary only. However, I didn't find a bound or analysis regarding the error introduced in this relaxation.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "I find the proposed idea to be novel.\nHowever, the writing of the paper should be significantly improved.\nConcretely, \n- The figures are not clear. For example, Figure 1 has a very brief caption, making the figure very hard to understand.\n- Equation 2 is defined very vaguely. T_v^(l) is not defined, should we interpret it as a WL subtree? \n- Definition of \"perfect matching\" is confusing, \"a matching of a graph in which every node of the graph is incident to exactly one edge\". Based on the definition of graph matching, we always match a query graph with a target graph. How do we match within a single graph?",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this paper outlines a novel approach for deep learning based subgraph matching. Although I agree with the novelty of the proposed idea, I feel the paper is kind of overclaiming the theoretical contribution of the paper. The paper also needs to evaluate the proposed approach more thoroughly, by including runtime analysis and comparing against exact graph-matching baselines. Finally, the writing of the paper should be improved.\nOverall, I think there is significant room for improving this paper.",

Training-test split may have large impact on the performance, e.g., on Mutag and Protein. Please specify the details (e.g., random seeds, how many time the 5-fold CV was run)\n3.

The usage of the word \u201cneighbor\u201d for different scenarios at the same time made me confused. For example, in section 4: \u201cMotivated by Hall\u2019s marriage Theorem 3.1, we develop an efficient algorithm to address the perfect matching procedure. A straightforward solution is to randomly select a subset W from the given set of neighbors, N(q), and count whether the corresponding neighbors of W, i.e. N(W), have more elements than this subset. After repeating this process multiple times for all node pairs, we obtain a perfect matching when no instance violates the criterion.\u201d\n2. Figure 1 perfect matching table is a bit confusing. \n",

The theoretical study is interesting, regarding existing graph matching learning papers are usually empirical.\n2. The proposed method improves performances on 7 experimented datasets, some by a substantial margin.\n3. The empirical results show that GNNs tend to capture the data distribution divergence, and have bad performance on evenly distributed data, motivating further research.\n\n**Weakness:**\n1. The degeneracy property can be broken by simply inserting or removing an edge, so the model can be easily attacked and may not be robust to noise.\n2. The ablation study of GNN shows that the improvement is mainly from the GNN module. Also, the paper does not show the subtree modeling's effect on performance improvement, such as demonstrating recall on experimented datasets.",
