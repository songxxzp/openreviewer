However, I felt that readers who are less familiar with this area will be unable to follow the paper as the introduction (Section 1), Problem Formulation (Section 2), and the theorem in Section 3 are not well written.\n\nI have recommended rejecting the paper because of the combination of (i) clarity of the writing in both motivating the problem and formulating the problem, and (ii) the novelty proposed is incremental which can pretty much be summarized by Eq.(1)",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of ICA with multiple views, where the goal is to estimate independent sources shared by a group of subject. The originality of this work lies in the addition of individual sources: the data of each subject is a mixture of individual and shared sources, allowing for a more flexible model. The authors demonstrate the identifiability of the proposed model, and propose an algorithm to recover sources and mixing matrices. The authors finally validate their approach on synthetic and genomics problems.",

Trivialization methods were originally developed for deep learning. Here using these methods destroys some of the nice structure of the problem. For instance we lose the Hessian structure that is used in [Ablin et al 18] and [Richard et al. 20] to get fast algorithms. I think that this is why the proposed method is slower than MultiviewICA (fig.3), while using a similar optimization technique as in [Richard et al. 20] should give a similar runtime.\n- The  authors do not release code for the peer review phase, which greatly hinders the reproducibility of this work",

If the authors use the picard package then this is definitely not infomax.\n- The fonts in the figures are sometimes too small - they should be of the same size as the text",

The method is demonstrated to outperform competing methods in specific conditions, mostly when there are tens of views.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The theoretical guarantee for identifiability for multi-view learning setups is a valuable contribution\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The motivation for multi-view BSS remains poor. The concert example is clearly artificial and the other examples (fMRI etc) are not explained well enough to understand why they correspond to multi-view BSS tasks. The linearity assumption is also poorly motivated, by merely stating that it holds in these applications. It is far from obvious for the reader why fMRI or biological datasets would exhibit prominently linear mixing.\n- Core method is poorly explained and seems to be fairly incremental",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is in general relatively well written and easy to understand, but remains on too high level of abstraction. The task itself is motivated by listing application domains, rather than explaining properly how they are best addressed as multi-view blind source separation problems, and the optimization algorithm is explained only by references to Lezcano-Casado's works and by introducing the notation for the problem formulation. A more formal treatment would be helpful. The technical sections also make the paper feel rather incremental -- every core element is explained by saying how it follows directly from a specific previous work, without really explaining why these choices were made; multi-view models for the basic structure, Richard et al. (2020) for the likelihood expression, and Lezcano-Casado et al. for optimization. The Supplement includes detailed derivation of the mathematical details and suggests that there may be non-trivial elements, but they are not properly communicated in the main paper. Finally, the identifiability proof (which is probably the most interesting result) builds on standard results of Comon (1994) and Davies (2004).\n\nThe main problem of the work is that the problem setup itself is poorly motivated. As someone who was worked on MRI data, ICA and multi-view setups I can imagine there are indeed ways of representing MRI data analysis tasks as multi-view BSS problems, but I feel that I would have no hope of understanding the main motivations of this work without having this personal background. For instance, I could not accept the validity of the linearity assumption if not knowing how MRI works and what it measures. Most importantly, however, I do not think you ever give a proper justification on why we should be interested in the specific problem formulation in Section 2. You provide a technical definition and you provide high-level motivation of multi-view settings being interesting in general, but it feels like you are not really verbalising the need for these methods in the context of ICA/BSS.\n\nThe empirical experiments are reasonably carried out, but the results do not stand out as strong enough to override the somewhat weak presentation and incremental contribution. It seems that the proposed method works very well on artificial data with high (tens) number of views, but since the paper does not provide good examples of tasks that need this the result remains weak. The transcriptome data, in turn, is a not very easy to understand for typical ICLR readers and while it serves as a nice demonstration it does not add much value.\n",
