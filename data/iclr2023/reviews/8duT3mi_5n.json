They first formalize a dynamic graph homophily theory with both signs and distances, and accordingly refine the topology by designing the signed target oriented message passing and the layer importance based propagation. Experimental results on four dynamic graphs verify the superiority of proposed GReTo.",

In addition, mean and standard deviation for each method are recommended to make the experimental results more convincing.\n\n2.The ablation result analysis is not very convincing. Except the Temperature dataset, the variant V-Mix is always close to the full variant version, which means that not always all the components are needed.\n\n3.It is necessary to discuss whether the proposed GReTo can learn on dynamic graphs with large average time intervals and higher temporal node degrees.\n\n4.Some minor mistakes, Figures 2 and 7 are repeated.",

I think the authors could motivate each of the proposed module a little before detailed description. To be specific, it would be better to add summary at the beginning of subsection 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nThe authors should carefully check their citing format- \\citet{} and \\citep{} are different and should be used accordingly.\n",
