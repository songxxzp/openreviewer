But the motivation what we could benefit from the generated images is not very clear. \n\nThere are some questions:\n1. The authors need to provide more examples when the generated images help. The reviewer is confusing that we can generate an image for each sample or only for a whole set of tabular data.\n2. The authors may consider providing more illustration examples in the paper. The current illustration images seem to be subjective.\n3. Does the ability of the method depend on the quality of the pre-trained model?\n4. In some real-world tasks, we may not know the exact meaning of the column, and it is difficult to find the pre-trained model in the specific area. For example, if the table is related to housing prices or climate change, could the authors show the corresponding images?",

The author's test strategies directly generate images from tabular data (which can include numerical values).

Generated images are evaluated using FID and LPIPS, and results for methods are additionally qualitatively discussed. ",

            "summary_of_the_review": "I think the idea is interesting from an application perspective, and the problem is very well defined by the authors- specifically the problem of generating a \"visual summary\" of table data. But throughout the paper, there is not enough detail on the data that the models are being trained on. Additionally,  there is not nearly enough qualitative output - which would be expected for a paper that aims to do conditional generation. When figures exist are generally hard to follow and sometimes actively confusing (ex: components of Figure 1). \n\nNo evaluation in the paper seems to critically address one big component of the paper - do the resulting images well summarise the table data in some meaningful way? While I understand this is very difficult to quantify, there is zero to minimal discussion on this point. Since this is a conditional generation problem, do my generated images in some way tell me about the data they are generated from? A good solution to this problem would not just generate images that are not only high quality, which your metrics measure, but also relevant to the data they are conditioned on, and I'm not sure that this is addressed in any detail.",

It is hard to follow this paper.\n- The technical contributions are limited. This work simply applies prior techniques, e.g., DALL-E, GPT3, VQGAN, and TABBIE, to the tabular-data-to-image generation, lacking novel technical designs.\n- The experimental evaluation is weak. The results in Section 6 are insufficient to support the main claim in the Abstract, that is, \"The set of generated images provides an intuitive visual summary of the tabular data\".\n- In Section 6.1 Qualitative Results, this paper mainly discusses the quality of generated images. However, from my point of view, the correlation between the tabular input and the generated images is more worthwhile to discuss.\n- The proposed benchmark only contains 300 pairs of tables and images with a limited number of categories. I don't think this is sufficient to train a generative model for real-world tabular-data-to-image generation problems.",
