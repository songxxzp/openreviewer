In the problem an attacker can perturb the loss function and wants to steer the bandit algorithm to select a target action of the attacker's choice. The authors presented methods to pertub the loss function to achieve this goal in two different settings, and showed that the methods incur only sublinear attack costs. Experiments were also conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.",

The idea of manipulating an adversarial bandit is novel and very interesting. The theoretical results are well-presented.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper develops some attack strategies for adversarial bandits. They design two attack policies that need a sublinear cost of corrupting the original loss of arms and resulting in a linear regret for the bandit algorithm. On the lower bound side, the authors show their attack policy is optimal in the sense that there is no better attack policy with less cost that can degrade the regret of the bandit algorithms. Last, experimental results show that the proposed attack policy can degrade the regret of the existing bandit algorithms. ",

Consider the easy attack setting. The attacker will set the loss of all arms but the target arm to 1. This means that the attacker has to pay at most $(K-1)\\times T$ for corrupting the loss of all other arms. However, the authors simply ignore this huge cost and calculate the cost only for the selected arm. This is the case for the general attack case also. If this observation is correct (I urge the authors to clarify this in rebuttal), the contribution of this paper is not interesting at all since the attacker is paying a huge cost of changing the entire game in their favor, but the authors just claim this is still good (sublinear cost) since only they count the cost when a corrupted arm is selected. \n\n- Beyond the above major issue, I think the contribution of this paper is interesting but not surprising in terms of the attack design. The attack idea is very straightforward, i.e., set the loss of all arms except the target arm to 1. Nothing intellectually interesting here. \n\n",

This result try to motivate the problem through online recommendation.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This is primarily a theory paper. The experiments are in simulation. Overall results look fine; for a theory paper the theory is not too much of an advance but ok.\n\nThe attacks are straightforward enough, essentially making all other arms unattractive. But I am left wondering what would happen (theoretically) if a robust algorithm was being used, meaning the defender is aware of an attacker of the type in this paper - would the result of the attack be different? My view is possibly not, because the attacker has no much power here as to arbitrarily modify the reward (with a liberal cost allowance that can grow with T), which in my view also makes the attacker's task simple.\nIs the concept of regret w.r.t. to the original rewards meaningful here? (meaning the defender observes changed rewards but collects the true reward in practice) If meaningful, what happens to this original regret value?\n\n\nIt would have been easier to see the graphs if the quantities were plotted averaged over T. It would have been nice if the dependence on the number of arms was also included in the formulas of the results.
