            "summary_of_the_paper": "= Update after rebuttal =\n\nI thank the authors for their response to my comments. I maintain my recommendation for acceptance.\n\n= Original review =\n\nThe authors show how to optimize the shape of an elastic material, as well as neural networks to control its actuators, imn order  to make the material perform various mechanical tasks. \n\nBoth the material's  shape and the controlling neural network  are optimized by gradient descent for various task domains. Given a target action (which,  depending on the  domain, might be a location for  a point, a shape,  or even an MNIST digit image to be classified), the neural network translates a specification of  the action into adequate actuations, through which the optimized shape performs the  specified action.\n\nThe authors apply their method to translation/rotation of a point on the material, controlled deformation of a  shape, and -  remarkably - translating MNIST images into seven-segment digit displays through deformation of a colored shape  seen through slits.\n\nThe authors also show a working real-life implementation of the system, demonstrating practical applicability.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n- The method is novel (to my knowledge) and interesting. While there has been much work on optimizing morphologies and controllers jointly (e.g. Karl Sims and other \"virtual creatures\" models - these should be cited!), as well as optimizing elastic shapes (e.g.  Sodarace), the system described here  looks like nothing I'm aware of.\n\nWeaknesses: \n\n- The only minor defect I can see is that some points in the explanation could be clarified - see below",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is well written throughout. Just a  few clarifications:\n\n- What exactly are the \"actuations\" mentioned in the figures? We just see blue vertical or horizontal brackets on each side of the square, but it's not clear what the actuation actually does - I initially thought  it would be squeezing along the direction of the bracket but that doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n- The purpose of section 2.3 might be explained a little  bit more - what exactly are we computing here and how is it used in the system?\n\n- Caption of Figure 8 a): should the first \"optimized\" be \"unoptimized\"?\n\n- Typo in the last paragraph of p. 4, \"e.g.,wel\"\n",

The control tasks are allowed to be image, coordinate on scalar parameter based on the end goal, which are mapped on to a latent dimension (using an encoder) matching the number of linear actuations. The decoder is a differentiable simulation that solves for equilibrium of non-linear elastic materials under mechanical load that takes the geometric design parameters and actuations (output from encoder). The solver is made differentiable wrt the geometry parameters (represented as a porous shape with quadrilateral boundary) by adopting isogeometic/FEM analysis and B-spline basis to solve the PDE. The results show that the geometry and control co-design is able to achieve translation, rotation and shape matching efficiently and better than geometry-only scenario.  It is interesting to see the digital MNIST benchmark and the application of this approach to that case",

Is this an optimisation issue? Or is this some repeating, near optimal, solution (maybe one that also appears in nature after evolution)?\n\nThe MNIST experiments are really cool, although I am thinking that the encoder network probably just does the classification and then translates this into the actuation for the 7 slit representation. But even if this is a bit of a gimmick, it is still a very cool demonstration!\n\nQuality: Very high, as far as I can tell. It might be nice to include a section with limitations and optimisation pitfalls, i.e., all the things you tried on the way that did not work \u2013 that would be helpful for other researchers to build on this work.\n\nNovelty, I cannot really judge because I don\u2019t work in this area of meta materials.
