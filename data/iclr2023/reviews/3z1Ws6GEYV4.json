How is diversity defined if it is not to cover the Pareto front of a multi-objective optimization problem?\n2.\tThe proposed algorithm is mainly based on the assumption that a multi-objective optimization problem can be viewed as a family of single-objective problems defined by non-negative weighted vectors. This might be inappropriate when the Pareto front is not convex. \n3.\tSimilar to this paper, decomposition-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms such as MOEA/D solve multi-objective optimization problems by considering a set of single-objective sub-problems.

It has many drawbacks, especially when non-convex Pareto front is encountered. But in Section 2.1, the authors claim solving weighted sum scalarization equals solving MOO.
