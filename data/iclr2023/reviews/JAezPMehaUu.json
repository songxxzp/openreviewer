            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a simple modification of multi-view augmentation for use with representation learning, as well as an additional training framework to go with it. The main idea is to create a richer set of background with higher resolution than available with the multi-crop strategy. Because the augmented data is mosaiced, the author apply ROI-align to extract only relevant ROI of the feature map before transforming it to the embedding space. The contrastive loss is applied to the appropriate part of the embedding from the standard view of the input image as well as from its mosaiced version. Experiments are given and demonstrate 0.5-1.5% improvement over the multi-crop technique.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\nThe technique is simple and is well-motivated. The multi-crop strategy leads to low-resolution negative sample, which can be of limited use if the background in the image are textured and include a lot of visual detail. By grabbing higher resolution patch and place it into the view, the author have achieve a more challenging background for the model to learn from.\nThe improvement over the multi-crop technique is appreciable. The difference ranges from 0.5-1.5 point, which is not large, but appreciable.\nThe experiments are comprehensive, and I find enough details are given to be reproducible. The comparison is fair, as the author retrain the model used for comparison. It may have been useful to actually tuned hyperparameter per augmentation strategy as well. As written, it seems like the hyperparameters were pre-selected and applied across board.\n\nWeakness: \nI find the clarity of writing to be the main issue here. It would be much simpler to explain the augmentation algorithm as well as the representation learning methodology using a diagram. Using equations is prone to error, and also harder to understand. As written, there are some errors (index i is overloaded: i-th mosaic, and also i-th image in eq 8). This makes a text that is already hard to understand even harder.\nNo code was promised, following the above point, without a clearly explained method, it is hard to reimplement the work here. I believe there is no promise of code release here, so I think it can be challenging for other researcher to try to reimplement this exactly.\nLastly, the paper can be stronger if the ablation study is used to justify technical choices. For example, one main motivation for this work is to have a more complex background. It may be interesting for the author to try to vary the resolution of the background patch in the mosaic, and see if there is any change in model performance. As presented, it seems more like a tuning exercise for alpha and theta.",

Multi-crop augmentation has been shown to provide consistent improvements in representation learning. This is achieved by using 2 \"large crop\" views that capture \"global\" information of the image, and a number of much smaller crops that capture the \"local\" information. \n\nThe authors argue that naive small crops tend to lead to lowered mutual information between views (although they do not use the term \"mutual information\"), thereby leading to suboptimal performance. The authors argue that by creating synthetic backgrounds for the small crops, mutual information is reduced, thereby leading to stronger (more discriminative) features. \n\nA comprehensive set of experiments shows the benefits of their approach on classification and transfer learning tasks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1. The method is simple, although possibly details of implementations could be a little complicated (e.g. to ensure that features are re-arranged to correlate small and large crop views). \n\n2. Strong empirical results on various tasks such as classification and linear transfer.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThere is a very limited understanding of the idea other than \"diverse backgrounds\". What exactly improves the features? Did the authors try ablation such as simply adding background noise to the views? \n\nI'm curious how this approach could be applied to vision transformers, since those architectures are increasingly more common.",
