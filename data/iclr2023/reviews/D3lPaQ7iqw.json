            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new model to evaluate Parkinson's disease feature extraction. In particular room-to-room classification. I'm not sure if the paper proposes a new dataset, but I think they do (it is not clear from the writings). In the experimental sections there's very close performances and very high standard deviations, it is unclear to me if the proposed methods works better. I have the following more detailed comments below:\n\n\"Indoor localisation, including its in-home mobility features\" this sentence does not make sense to me.\n\"To improve the effectiveness of current methods for indoor localisa-\ntion, a transformer-based approach utilising multiple modalities, Received Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) and accelerometer data from wearable devices, which\nprovide complementary views of movement, is proposed.\" please rephrase this is hard to read.\n\"To properly evaluate our proposed method, we use a free-living dataset where the movements and mobility are greatly varied and unstructured as expected in real-world conditions. \" What's a free-living dataset? is this a standard to define such a dataset? please provide references in your commentary.\n\"12 pairs of people (one with PD, and the other a control participant) lived for five days\nin a smart home with various sensors.\" Is this your own dataset? what is \"various sensors\"?\nReading the abstract it's clear that the authors are either novices, not native english speakers, or the PI didn't bother to help writing it. It's cluttered and cumbersome to digest. It should be clear, crisp, and spot-on.\n\n\"Although PD is a slowly progressive disease, the symptoms can fluctuate hourly depending on medication intake timing, stress and other factors.\" citation? where do you get this information from?\n\n\"These fluctuations make it challenging to capture the slow symptom progression in an individual (needed for example to measure how a new therapy changes disease progression) accurately over time using infrequent clinic or lab-based \u201csnapshot\u201d clinician-patient interactions. \" this sentence is hard to read, what are you trying to say?\n\n\"Also, to help a clinician understand the impact of PD on a patient, continuous monitoring is needed to give an accurate evaluation of how severe the symptoms and their fluctuations are for that individual.\" While I can intuitively think that this might be reasonable for a practitioner to know this information, I want a research study motivating it. If not, why are you then doing this research project?\n\n\"Indoor localisation can be used to measure transitions between rooms in a home\" can it? who says that? again, if you don't back up your statements with research papers I can't trust them. I don't know by default the state of the indoor localisation field. Moreover, the trailing citation is one 13 year old symposium paper on the \"potential\" of contextual awareness from wearables. I would expect a, somewhat recent, clinical journal paper formalizing the treatment procedure of Parkinson.\n\n\"To perform indoor localisation in home environments, IoT-based platforms with multimodal sensors combined with machine learning can be used to provide an unobtrusive and continuous localisation.\" I'm sure they can, but you need to prove it. Please provide a paper documenting this feature.\n\n\"Typically, a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used to produce a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) at points throughout a home, which can be used to create radio-map features for room-level localisation.\" If it's a typical setup, then you should have plenty of studies, or protocols, detailing it. Provide these.\n\nAt the end of your introduction, it seems like you work off the Jovan 2022 paper. It's not clear to me how you differ from their research findings. Make your motivation more clear in the introduction for what motivated your to alter their method, what you changed, why you believed those changes are important, and how much better you perform.\n\n\"Early work in machine ...\" you mention \"simple PD classification\". I'm not a PD researcher, I don't know what that means. This sentence does not make it clear to me how the initial models on PD prediction operates.\nFor the vision models you mention, what are they predicting? Why were they better? Is the main concern privacy?\n\n\"RSSI signals are not stable, they fluctuate randomly due to shadowing, fading and multi-path effects.\" I need a citation here.\n\nWhat wearable are you using in your study, is it a fitbit? and apple watch?\n\n\"To measure the accuracy ML models\" I don't understand this\n\nWhat did you use the camera data for? did a person manually sit and look it through to annotate the gold label for when participants when to different rooms? how did this work at night?\n\nAre you preprocessing steps standard in the field? why don't you cite any papers?\n\nYour data preprocessing is not completely clear to me.\n\nFor your dataset, did you collect it yourself, or where is it from? if you collected it yourself, where's your IRB? Why did you need to gather a new dataset, was it just for medicatio ON/OFF?\n\nThe math explaining your model is confusing, it doesn't give me a clear overview of how your model differs from the Jovan 2022 paper. As far as I understand your modification is applying a CNN layer at the start and a CRF layer at the end?\n\nTable 2, ALL-HC ours the performance reported is 17.70 (16.17). Does that mean you have 17.70 mean accuracy and 16.17 standard deviation?\n\nHow many of your results are statistically significant?",

Transfer between some rooms is inferred correctly, whereas for some not. The interpretation of the results is not very clear. The results show that the method outperforms a benchmark that has been considered as the state-of-the-art method. However, some more traditional methods outperform the developed one. Therefore, the effect seems to be quite incremental.",
