            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a general framework to solve the high dimensional continuum armed bandit problem and high dimensional contextual bandit problem jointly. This research problem is significant and the proposed model is novel. I agree that the proposed problem has broad scope of applications. For this problem, the paper propose an efficient algorithm called Hi-CCAB, by adopting the low-rank matrix estimator. Experimental study shows the proposed method can improve the naive approach by 4 times for the cumulative reward. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": " However, I have the following concerns about the exploration manner, related works and experimental design. \n(1)\tAlthough the proposed model is based the low rank representation matrix assumption, I cannot get the reason why the epsilon term is bounded. Previous works usually assume a sub-gaussian distribution for the error term. I suggest the authors to explain why the low-rank assumption is enough to bound the epsilon. \n\n(2)\tThe paper gives two different manner (2 different gaussian distribution) for exploration in each step. Theorem 1 shows the regret bound based on the first one. What about the another one? Is it possible for us to propose a general regret bound which is independent on the distribution used in the exploration?\n\n(3)\tThere are some important related works are missing. Recently the direction of proposing deep learning based model for high dimensional contextual bandit problem is very hot, especially for the complex non-linear model assumption.

In: NIPS, pp. 8580\u20138589 (2018)\nIf we concatenated the continuum arm space and contextual vector totally as a large feature vector, we can use these existing methods to solve it. Thus the paper should be compared to them. \n\n(4)\tThe experiment study is a toy. Only one navie method is compared to Hi-CCB with the simulation in a small dataset. Thus it is very hard to support the conclusion. I suggest the authors to justify by some public large data for real problem. In fact, we can compare with baselines in each of special case problems.\n\nMinor problem:\n(1)\tAll figures are blur. \n",

And the two phases (low-rank representation learning + policy learning) although interleaved, seem to be quite modular.\n\nWeaknesses/questions/remarks:\n- Could you elaborate on the choice of $w^{3/2}$?\n- The theoretical part is not very strong in the sense that we do not really know how to assess Theorem 1. I would suggest the authors to interpret a bit Theorem 1 since it is not very common to look at the 'time-averaged regret', so some interpretation would be appreciated. In particular, could elaborate on the order $1/13$, and how is it related to the dimensions?\n- On the experiment side, as I mentioned I find the proposed two-step algorithm quite modular. That's a good point, but at the same it means that we can also try other kind of contextual bandit algorithms (or even kernel/graph/combinatorial bandit algorithms), at least as some benchmark to compare with. \n- Another point on the experiment - as the authors claim that the proposed model covers also some other more classic bandit models, a small sanity check (both experimentally and theoretically actually) that could've been done is to check the performance of the proposed algorithm under these classic models.\n- Literature review is somehow not very thorough (at least on the bandit side, contextual bandits, continuum bandits, rank-1 bandits etc), but that's a minor point.",
