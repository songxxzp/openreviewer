The authors mentioned that FairGNN [Dai & Wang (2021)] also involves the missing attribute problem, and claimed that the paper only assumes that a part of the sensitive attributes is missing. However, I don't see many differences between partial missing and full missing for nodes. What makes the full missing setting more challenging? What is the technical difficulty of proposing methods under this setting compared to the partial missing setting? These problems should be discussed more.\n- The empirical results seem not that powerful to me. The performance of FairAC is quite close to FairGNN, sometimes better and sometimes worse with slight differences. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a method (FairAC) to jointly addresses the graph attribute completion and graph unfairness problems due to both feature unfairness and topological unfairness due to missing attributes.\nThe model uses a set of $V_{keep}$ and $V_{drop}$ nodes as in Jin et al. (2001) and uses attribute completion with attention mechanism for nodes without features (this may introduce topological unfairness which   is handled by a sensitive classifier) and uses feature unfairness mitigation for nodes with attributes by removing implicit sensitive information that is present in non-sensitive attributes via an autoencoder. Fairness is measured through Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity. \nThe experiments compare FairAC with several baselines on three datasets. It tests node classification accuracy, fairness w.r.t. sensitive attributes, and effects of sensitive attributes, missing rates, and ablations (attribute missing rate, adversarial training loss relevance, and the tradeoff hyper parameter $\\beta$).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "With respect to the strengths, the paper is well organized, the problem is relevant to the ML community, particularly the graph-learning and GNN and network science communities. Clear goals despite some imprecisions in the definitions. Relative parsimonious model that deals with specific sub-goals to achieve the final aim of fairness in completion.\nThere are some areas where the paper could be improved. For instance, there are several imprecisions such as in the abstract where it is stated \"FairAC can be applied to any graph and generate fair embeddings\u201d. The evidence provided is solid but stating that it will generate fair embedding to any graph is too optimistic. The definition of matrix $\\mathcal X$ is that it has a dimension of attributes $D$ yet each of the labels (and their predictions) are defined as a unidimensional $y \\in{0,1}$. The problem definition is a little hand-wavy. What is a fair feature embedding? The concept of \u201cfair attribute completion model\u201d  relies on fair feature embedding and, although it is discussed in other paragraph that it is measured via Statistical Parity and Equal Opportunity, the concept is not formally defined. The feature unfairness description regarding how \u201csome non-sensitive attributes could infer sensitive information\u201d seems not to be measured by Statistical Parity (SP) and Equal Opportunity (EO). The former implies also a privacy concerned while SP and EO deal with fairness of representation. Finally, the statement \"removing sensitive information implicitly contained in non-sensitive attributes\" has also the implication that sensitive information removed could affect performance when the amount of datapoint from subjects belonging to a minority group is not well represented. How is that scenario handled?",
