            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a novel method for joint antibody sequence/structure design. The paper introduces / combines multiple innovations:\n\n* Modeling antibody heavy + light chain, along with antigen\n* Joint sequence / structure design\n* Iterative prediction of outputs\n\nWhile some of these have been introduced before, the combination is very interesting and results in compelling results on the downstream task of antibody design.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* Multiple novel contributions.\n    - Modeling all components of the antibody/antigen complex\n    - joint sequence/structure design\n    - iterative prediction of model outputs.\n* Convincing and strong results on multiple downstream benchmarks. Dataset splits are constructed well and baselines (both neural and non-neural) are compared to appropriately.\n* Ablations of model are included to verify claims as to the utility of the different additions.\n* Well written paper. Model and experimental results are well explained and an appropriate level of detail is provided to understand the data split strategy and baselines. \n\nWeaknesses:\nTo be honest, I see no major weaknesses in the paper that must be addressed before publication. Below, I've listed some questions for future work and other minor comments.\n\nQuestions / Future Work:\n- It is interesting that the graph is constructed without full knowledge of the location of all residues - a linear imputation is used for missing residues. It would be nice to analyze this a bit further - how much do residues move from this initialization? How \"accurate\" is the initial graph structure - are there edges missing/present in the initial graph vs. in the \"true\" graph and how much does the graph change over iterations of the iterative refinement?\n- Related to the point above, it seems this constructions works in part because much of the antibody structure is already known. Would it be possible to apply the method to general sequence design, as opposed to loop re-design (e.g. Dauparas et al. 2022, science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add2187)? This would be a breakthrough result if so.\n- Ultimately, in-silico evaluations for protein design only go so far. It would be great to see the designs verified experimentally.\n- The authors note the current model cannot model sidechains. I do think this is a limitation that future work should explore, as it seems this would be important for the design of binding.\n\nMinor Comments:\n- It was slightly hard for me to associate different tables with experiments / datasets at a glance (e.g. it took me a little bit to figure out what exactly is the difference between Table 1 and Table 2 (left)). Perhaps the experiments section could include a bulleted list of datasets used, or this could be more clearly highlighted in the table captions.",

The experiment section is perhaps a little dense and a few more signposts could be provided for easier reading, and easier understanding what each experiment is supposed to show.\n\nQuality: The paper is technically sound, with thorough benchmarks and baselines. Methods are well explained. Results are quite good.\n\nNovelty: While some components have been introduced in previous papers, the authors combine them in a novel way, introduce some new modeling ideas, and achieve excellent results.\n\nReproducibility: Authors provided anonymized source code and thoroughly documented all dataset generation methods.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Designing Antibody CDR sequences is of great interest for studying antibody biology and for therapeutics research. This task has been addressed computationally using search based frameworks (eg. using rosetta energies) and more recently, machine learning based generative models. This paper introduces a novel equivariant GNN framework for co-generating CDR sequences and structures. They evaluate the generative capacity of this model using standard benchmarks on sequence and structure generation (i.e Amino Acid Recovery/AAR and Structure RMSD). They demonstrate novel utility of this model in the task of optimizing the binding affinity of a candidate antibody. Lastly, they suggest a pipeline for generating a CDR sequence when the binding complex is unknown using a docking search approach.\n\nA major contribution this paper has made to the field is the capacity to conditionally model the antigen structure in the CDR generation. They implement this via an \u201cexternal context encoder\u201d attention mechanism which passes information from antigen residues to CDR residues in the hidden layer updates. The architecture for the message passing and attention paradigms are also novel and constructed to be equivariant, which is a required feature for a model operating on coordinate data. As the primary function of antibody CDR regions are to bind to target antigens, it follows that modelling the target structure in the generative model would be important. Thus this is an important contribution. \n\nThis paper compares its method to a previously published generative sequence-structure co-design model (RefineGNN from Jin et al 2021), an unconditional sequence model (from Saka et al 2021) and an Rosetta energy based search method (RAbD, Adolf-Bryfogle 2018). They show state-of-the-art performance on AAR and RMSD metrics, with quite significant improvements. \n\nThe paper also presents a novel sequence generation scheme, Progressive Full-Shot Decoding, which is faster than prior decoding techniques. They show in their ablation study that the decoding scheme hugely contributes to their performance gains.\n\nWhile a prior generative model paper (Jin et al 2021)  developed an algorithm for optimizing the binding affinity of antibodies, that method required an antigen specific oracle trained on experimental data. This paper takes the approach a step further by leveraging a delta-delta-G predictor from Shan et al 2022, which allows the algorithm to be used on any antibody-antigen pair for which a structure is available. The authors show their model outperforms other benchmarks using this pipeline in terms of generated antibody with lowest energy.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The model architecture the authors develop is very thoughtfully constructed and the gains are demonstrated in the state-of-the-art performance. Their ablation study is an important addition, as it shows which aspect of the method contribute most to its performance gains. The use of Progressive Full-shot decoding was the biggest contributor to performance while also having major run-time gains. This suggests that it could have promise for utilization in other methods as well. \n\nThe authors did not give much explanation as to why a message propagation paradigm was used with the internal encoder and a graph attention scheme used in the external encoder. The ablation study also demonstrated that the attention scheme did not contribute hugely to the performance. Some more explication of the modelling decisions would be beneficial.\n\nThe \u201cAffinity Optimization\u201d experiment is a great section of the paper, and moves towards real-world usage of these methods. The authors show their method is able to generate a CDR with the biggest decrease in delta-delta-G (a proxy for binding affinity) compared to benchmarks. To make the result more biologically interpretable it would have been useful to have an idea of how much a delta-delta-G decrease contributes to a decrease in binding affinity (as measured by Kd for example). This could have been done using the Shan et al model and comparing to test performance on the SKEMPI set. While this correlation would be different for different protein interactions, it could have been a useful discussion point. Using a general delta-delta-G predictor over an oracle model trained on experimental data is a clever extension ofhe Iterative Target Augmentation algorithm for this use-case. However, while the authors do mention that they only benchmark on antibody complexes within the training set of the Shan et al model to ensure generalizability, this points to how the efficacy of this pipeline for any candidate antibody is limited by the generalizability of the predictor. While this is not a fault of their proposed model, if this pipeline is a major point of utility of this paper, it is a point worth discussing.\n\nWhile the authors do cite a major paper in the field for sequence-structure co-design (Jin et al 2021), they do not mention the new paper from that group (Jin et al 2022) which makes similar developments on its prior model as this paper performs (eg. modelling the antigen structure in the CDR generation). Furthermore, in terms of benchmarks, while the authors\u2019 model did show state-of-the-art performance when compared to any cited paper, there are some discrepancies in RefineGNN\u2019s RAbD benchmark performance between the original Jin 2021 paper and this paper\u2019s reproduction of it. Lastly, it seems that the authors criticize RefineGNN for not being invariant in its loss calculation, however this is not the case.\n\nA high level thought : An overall weakness of this work is common to much of the published work in this field; i.e.  the work does not  really address the \"real world\" problem of antibody design; - the 'real-world' question should be given an antigen target, design an antibody that will bind with high affinity and specificity. However good a method is at predicting antibody binding to a specific epitope on a target antigen, and however well the model can generate sequences and structures that bind that epitope - the 'real-world' question should be able to find new epitopes, given an antigen target, design an antibody that will bind with high affinity and specificity.  Nevertheless , these authors do not claim to do this so thats fine - but the ML community should be aware that these evaluations and target problems only address a very narrow need- e.g. I have one epitope  on an antigen of know. structure - can I make a 'better' antibody to that specific target surface? \n\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is written quite clearly. The ideas are laid out well with clear demarcation of where the authors are expanding on the limits of the prior papers that they cite. The method is written out in detail displaying the most important aspects of the architecture. The proof of equivariance is easy to follow. The most unclear aspect of the method was the use of  si  in the progressive full short decoding. I understand these to be the learned embeddings, but they appear to be different from the hi outputted by the last layer of the model. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the authors could have discussed more their reasoning behind different message passing and/or attention paradigms beyond the equivariant construction.\n\nIn terms of novelty, while the paper is addressing a question that has been attempted by previous papers, it offers noteworthy contributions in the modelling approach. The authors propose an equivariant model over the invariance offered by RefineGNN (the primary benchmark). There have been many methods that have offered equivariant message passing schemes (eg. Jing 2020, Fuchs 2022). However, the specific construction of the update layers is novel as far as this paper is concerned, and the utilization of equivariance in the antibody sequence-structure co-design problem is novel. \n\nThey also try to extend their method to conditions in which a binding complex is not available by leveraging docking. The soundness of this approach is conditional on how believable the docking results are. However, not having a whole binding complex structure is a more real-world situation, so these developments are a step in the right direction.\n\nThe paper contributes all their code for their model along with reproduced benchmarks models, so the results should be highly reproducible.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper attempts to address the antibody heavy chain CDR sequence-structure co-design problem, though. They extend prior models on this task by incorporating conditioning on the target antigen and the light chain. The importance of incorporating this information is demonstrated by the major performance gains on established benchmarks. They also propose extended utility of this model in the goal of optimizing an antibody\u2019s affinity and also generating a heavy chain CDR when a full binding complex is not present using docking.\n\nThere are some limitations in this paper such as a lack of description of certain modelling decisions and asI wrote above, it does not address the CDR sequence-structure problem in general,  rather only for a specific binding surface which by definition has already had a structure of Ab:Antigen solved.  However, the improvements on benchmarks and new ideas of in silico optimization make this paper a good step in the direction of solving the in silico antibody design problem",
