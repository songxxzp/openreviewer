            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to regularize the codebook learning in a VQ-VAE\ntowards a uniform utilization of the codebook. The approach, termed\nOT-VAE, uses a clustering equipartion objective in the latent space to\nattain this goal. Experiments on small-scale datasets of three\ndifferent modalities show the approach improves the reconstruction\nerror and codebook utilization w.r.t. a VQ-VAE baseline, and improves\n3d motion generation for one dataset.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n- The paper is well written and the ideas are clearly explained.\n- The experimental results show the method is able to achieve\n  improvements in reconstruction accross multiple modalities (images,\n  speech, 3D dance motion), and improvements in the task of 3D dance\n  motion generation.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n- The experimental section is limited to small datasets. The most\n  interesting application of VQ-VAEs is possibly  generation\n  (learning the discrete latent prior). However, the impact of\n  the proposed OT-VAE for generation is only demonstrated for one\n  small (40 evaluation samples) 3D motion generation dataset, which in my opinion is\n  too weak a signal for validating the improvements of the method for\n  VQ-VAE-based generation.\n- Unless I missed it, the comparison should also show the\n  extra computation required to compute the $\\Gamma$ matrix (9). \n- I would suggest revising the general claim that the method \"does not\n  require heuristics\" (abstract, page 2), by clearly specifying the\n  kind of heuristic this is referring to.\n",

The empirical\nevidence for the impact of the proposed technique in learning the\ndiscrete prior (e.g. for compression or generation), is very limited.\nThis is a weakness being these some of the main applications of\nVQ-VAEs.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": " - As one key challenge of existing vector quantization methods comes from codebook collapse, this work proposes OT-VAE, which regularizes the quantization by explicitly assigning equal number of samples to each code. \n\n - The proposed method enforces the full utilization of the codebook while not requiring any heuristics. \n\n - Across three different data modalities, the authors empirically demonstrate that OT-VAE shows better reconstruction compared to other VQ-VAE variants. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "#### **Strength**\n\n  - The problem of Vector Quantization is timely and important, with increasing number of applications. The method is also well-motivated, as existing key challenges in VQ lie in low codebook usage. \n\n - The approach is well-represented. The authors make the tables and figures easy to follow and nicely-illustrated.\n\n - Extensive experiments across three different modalities are conducted. Notably, OT-VAE achieves state-of-the-art results on 3D dance generation.\n\n\n#### **Weaknesses**\n\n - The authors stated that OT-VAE does not need to include other heuristics, such as stop-gradient, EMA, codebook reset. However, according to Table 5, the method is relatively sensitive towards regularization weight and initial temperature. Therefore, additional burdens on tuning these parameters exist.\n\n - The technique of L2 normalization has been adopted in ViT-VQGAN, which is not discussed here.\n\n - Quantitative improvements seem to be limited, especially for image modality, as there exists no qualitative comparisons except for 3D dance generation.",
