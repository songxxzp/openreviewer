            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new framework for unsupervised manifold alignment with joint multidimensional scaling. It combines a MDS method with a optimal transport to join the embedding. The main contribution is the combination of these two methods forming a general framework and a optimization scheme to solve both problems jointly. The experiments shows interesting results on two different tasks (visual exploration and graph matching).  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strength\n\nThe proposed framework is interesting on several points,\n1. It relies on tools with good mathematical properties. Optimal transport has now effective methods for solving the problem with appropriate regularization and MDS can be approximated with the SMACOF algorithm.Thus, both sub-optimization problems are easily solved.\n2. The experiments are strong with very good results for graph matching leading to potentially new methods.\n3. The generality of the framework opens it to many problems that occurs in different community (especially all the problematic around matching).\n4. The method seems easy to code and then enjoy a good reproducibility.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\nHowever I see several issues in the current work,\n1. While the state-of-art is mostly complete, the authors forget some recent methods that may be competititve [1].\n2. For graph matching, a comparison against KerGM [2] would be welcomed.\n3. The method does not scale to large dataset.\n4. There is no analysis of the convergence of Algorithm 1. Since it is a classical two stage optimization scheme, with appropriate hypothesis, convergence toward a stationary point should be possible [3].\n5. There is no comments about the initialization. How dependent are the results to the initialization? Is it stable enough?\n\n[1] Jin, K., Liu, C., & Xia, C. (2021). Two-Sided Wasserstein Procrustes Analysis.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes a practical method to jointly estimate the low dimension embedding in Euclidean space and the correspondences between data sets, which can be viewed as the alignment extension of classical embedding work by Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). Unlike some previous works in this domain, the proposed method is unsupervised by nature without given any known subset of alignment.  \n\nThis joint MDS framework is formulated as a combined stress objective function plus the additional matching penalty term from Wasserstein Procrustes analysis. Given this proposed join objective function is non-convex (same as similar problems), this paper proposed an alternative optimization algorithm (similar to EM type), which can be viewed as the combination of weighted MDS problem and Wasserstein Procrustes problem in each iteration. \n\nExperimental results on both synthetic data and real-world data (e.g., cell, MNIST, human body data, protein, etc) on a number of tasks from joint 2D visualization, domain adaptation, graph matching and protein alignment.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\nThe problem itself is interesting and the article is pleasant to read too, i.e., join alignment and embedding from 2 different data sets without supervision can be find a lot of application across NLP, computer vision, healthcare, biology, etc. \n\nThe optimization part is also solid as with enough considerations of previous works to joint optimize this non-convex problem by SMACOF algorithm and Wasserstein optimizations from (Alvarez-Melis et al., 2019), and with detailed analysis of computational complexity (Section 4.3), which is quite helpful to see. \n\nExperimental results also can be considered solid as across a number of synthetic or real data coupled with different tasks (with more results in Appendix B), and the proposed method often show (not always) the relative best performance among existing methods. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\nOne of the key concerns is, the proposed joint MDS method is based on MDS as the starting point, which utilize the (dis) similarities from Euclidean space and this may conflict with the nature of manifold embedding when data with strong nonlinear intrinsic geometry structure. Indeed, there are some discussions provided in Section 4.2, which is good to see, but still some unclear remains. As ISOMAP is essentially MDS coupled with geodesic distance, and not sure this is applied in which part of results in Section 5? (Maybe I missed).  Also, outside MDS and ISOMAP, there are other graph spectral works in this direction such as Laplacian Eigenmaps (and others), should be helpful to have some judgment for the choice in this work. \n\nAdditionally, it seems using GW as the initialization step (mentioned in Section 4.3) to provide a better coupling matrix P in the algorithm, make the contribution from this proposed iterative optimization less clear as maybe the non-convex formulation is good in theory but less practical in the numerical way. \n\nReference:\n1.
