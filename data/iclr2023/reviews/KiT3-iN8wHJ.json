            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a method for predicting pedestrian crossing intentions. The model is an extension of the PCPA model proposed in Kotseruba et al. On top of the PCPA model, they 1) added the traffic light inputs and 2) used the dropout method to predict the epistemic uncertainty.\n\nThe authors evaluated the proposed model on the PIE dataset, and the model is shown to improve the prediction accuracy over the PCPA baseline. Moreover, the predicted epistemic uncertainties are shown to correlate with the misclassification rate.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "--- Strengths\n\n- Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is an important problem. This paper presents a model that improves over the state-of-the-art baseline.\n\n\n--- Weakness\n\n- Novelty is the biggest issue of this paper. The network architecture proposed in this paper is almost exactly the same as the PCPA model in Kotseruba et al. The only difference is the addition of the traffic light inputs, which is a trivial change.\n\n- The improvement over the baseline is relative minor.\n\n- Although the evaluation result shows the proposed model improves the accuracy of pedestrian crossing prediction, but I doubt the real impact of this work. When the light on the ego lane is red, the ego vehicle will need to stop anyway, regardless of whether the pedestrian will cross the street or not. With the additional traffic light inputs, the model will unsurprisingly become better at predicting the crossing intention for those pedestrians crossing perpendicular to the ego vehicle, but the predictions for those pedestrians rarely matter. What truly matters is to predict whether a pedestrian will cross the street when the ego vehicle is moving (e.g., jaywalking).\n\n- The proposed model predicts the epistemic uncertainty, which can be addressed by adding more training data. What matters more is the aleatoric uncertainty.\n\n- The PIE dataset has only 880 training samples, which is way too small for this task. With a larger dataset, epistemic uncertainty will not matter that much anymore.",

            "summary_of_the_review": "The work has very limited novelty. The authors use existing methods (such as the architectures that they consider), and apply a new TL input without any deeper considerations or insights. In addition, they explore using dropout to estimate epistemic uncertainty which is a well-known method and no novelty can be claimed there. In fact, the authors only focus on epistemic and disregard aleatoric uncertainty, which would help and add some more novelty to the work. \nDetailed comments follow:\n- The authors say \"even the same gesture or activity may differ subtly\" to say that new features are needed to capture interactions, yet a few sentences later they say that this motivates them to use pose features which doesn't really help in that regard.\n- The architecture that is used is not well explained, and the authors should make their work more self-contained. E.g., they don't clarify well how are attentions implemented and what attends over what. They do provide a reference, however given already low novelty and the fact that this attention is explored quite a lot in the experiments, this important part of their methodology should be better explained in the text.\n- In relation to what are equations (1) and (2) added? It is unclear, they seem to be suddenly added to the text.\n- Traffic light info and its relevance should be discussed much more, given that that is the main topic of the work.\n- As explained at the end of Section 4.1, a lot of TL data is actually ignored (when it comes to pedestrians walking in parallel). More statistics about the data should be added to better quantify and understand this aspect.\n- How is MCD actually used in the work? Do you run multiple times and then average? This is not explained.\n- The authors point out that rare appearance of jaywalkers in the used data is affecting their results, however they do not dig deeper into this aspect which would be an interesting addition to the work. They leave it for future work which is unfortunate.\n- In general, the experimental results are not adding a lot of value, as many are already well known and discussed before (such as a large part of uncertainty results). I did find Fig 4 interesting however.",
