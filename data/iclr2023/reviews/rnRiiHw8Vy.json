            "summary_of_the_paper": "Image retrieval model can be updated when there is more training data or improved architecture, but it is not straightforward since old and new feature spaces are not compatible, leading to poor retrieval results between new query and old gallery embeddings. A naive solution is to replace the old features by new features from the new model, referred to as backfilling, but this may be computationally expensive and a blocker for model update. Although several compatible learning approaches have achieved compatible feature with the old model, it degrades the new model performance. To alleviate this issue, they consider two practical scenarios; 1) backfill the entire gallery set in random order and aim to maximize the average performance, and 2) backfill a partial gallery set and maximize the performance after partial backfilling. To this end, they train transformation models with uncertainty estimation using bayesian neural network and decide backfilling order based on the uncertainty of alignment loss.",

[1] also presents several simple uncertainty-based backfilling strategies based on the classification score, e.g., confidence uncertainty or entropy-based uncertainty. Could you report and compare the results using these strategies on top of baseline and your model? ex) (L_l2+disc)+ confidence uncertainty or (L_l2+disc+uncert) + confidence uncertainty.\n- More detailed analysis is needed. What classes of samples are first backfilled when performing the backfill strategy for each dataset? Is the class distribution uniform? or biased to some classes?\n- Robustness. How is the results when the model architecture is changed, e.g., ResNet-18 to ResNet-50? \n- Model bias section is weak. It presents the results on a single dataset with empirical observation only. There are some biased datasets, like as ImageNet-C, and more thorough analysis is needed to support the argument in that section. \n- There are some strange experimental results but no explanations.\n    - In Places-365, why new model gives worse result than old model in mAP? Even the results of mAP and CMC are conflicted.\n    - In ImageNet and Places-365, why there are negative flips? Is there any ways to do early stopping?\n- Why there is no BCT results on VGGFace2 and Places-365?\n\n[1] Hot-Refresh Model Upgrades with Regression-Alleviating Compatible Training in Image Retrieval,  Zhang et al, ICLR 2022\n",

            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper address the partial backfilling scenario to alleviate the limitation of existing works. The authors employ bayesian neural network to estimate the uncertainty of alignment error for efficient backfilling strategy. Although it improves the compatible performance, novelty is not strong and analysis and ablative study are insufficient, which makes the results not fully reliable.\n\n===== POST-REBUTTAL =====\n\nMy major concern is about the true effectiveness of proposed method, which mainly consists of FCT and Bayesian-based backfilling update where FCT is borrowed from the existing work. Thus, to convince the readers to use Bayesian uncertainty for backfilling process, I still think the performance gain of FastFill should be analyzed with previous work (confidence-based uncertainty from RACT [1]) under the fair setting (FCT as backbone algorithm). If not, the readers would simply use FCT+confidence rather than FastFill, which is easier to use. However, the performance gain is marginal in the standard setting (0.6%p on ImageNet-1K and 0.2%p on Places-365 in top@1), which makes the overall novelty limited. There are more gains in disjoint setting (2.7%p in top@1 and 0.5%p in mAP on ImageNet-[500:]), but the improvements are still moderate and need to re-write the overall paper with more thorough analysis to argue it as a main claim as there are insufficient experiments. The experimental results are not sufficient to verify the need to employ additional uncertainty head and training objective and the responses do not resolve my main concerns, thus I keep my original rating.\n\n[1] Hot-Refresh Model Upgrades with Regression-Alleviating Compatible Training in Image Retrieval,  Zhang et al, ICLR 2022\n",

For faster deployment, FastFill proposes to backfill the gallery images on-the-fly by a learned order that indicates the \u201chardness\u201d of the samples. Compared to previous approaches, FastFill demonstrates better performance for online partial backfilling on three retrieval benchmarks: imagenet1k, vggface2, and places365.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n\n[S1] Technology: the proposed method is technically sound;\n\n[S2] Performance: FastFill demonstrates better performance for online partial backfilling on imagenet1k, vggface2, and places365\n\n[S3] Presentation: the writing is clear\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe paper introduces a new evaluation setting: online partial backfilling. The goal is to deploy the features of the gallery set on-the-fly. FastFill only shows benefits in this setting. However, I\u2019m not sure if online partial backfilling is a feasible setting or of practical interest. \n\ni) If I understood correctly, Figure 1 (right) presents several configurations for image retrieval: (C1) old query features + old gallery features (\\phi_{old}(query) + \\phi_{old}(gallery)); (C2) new query features + old gallery features (\\phi_{new}(query) + \\phi_{old}(gallery)); (C3) new query features + new gallery features (\\phi_{new}(query) + \\phi_{new}(gallery)). Here FastFill is in between (C2) and (C3). Figure 1 (right) seems to indicate that (C2) has a better performance than (C1): 61.8% vs 46.6%. I\u2019m not sure if it is always the case as there may be a large shift in the feature spaces of \\phi_{old} and \\phi_{new}. I would guess the performance of (C1) is in between (C2) and (C3), e.g. a horizontal line between 61.8 and 68.2. In other words, at the early stage of the online backfilling (i.e. (C2)), the updated system may have lower performance than the old one. Therefore, it may not even be deployed. Also, I believe it is necessary to include the performance of (C1) in other diagrams, e.g. Fig.2/3/5.\n\nii) it is also hard to determine if the FastFill model or even (C3) actually has a better performance than (C1) without updating all the gallery features. The unseen query and gallery sets are the \u201cgolden\u201d test set that the new model never sees. While we may be able to estimate the performance of the FastFill model or (C3) on this \u201cgolden\u201d set in the middle of the backfilling, the estimation may not be conclusive or deserves the risk. As can be seen from Fig. 3 and 5, occasionally there may be performance drops at the last stage of the backfilling (>90%). \n\nAt this moment, I\u2019m not sure the online partial backfilling setting is convincing. This is my main concern.\n\n***\nAfter rebuttal:\n\nMy concern about the configurations (i.e. Weakness i) has been addressed. Regarding the online backfilling setting (i.e. Weakness ii), I agree that it is a more practical problem that may not be expected to be resolved in one research paper. I thereby raise the score to 6.

I also wonder if any information in the policy sampling can be used to not only determine the order but also what features should not be updated.\n- I personally think that the title \"Reducing model biases\" of 5.3 is misleading because Fastfill is not helping to reduce the biases of a model but simply \"catching up\" faster to the performance of the newer model, whatever bias/non-bias it has. It is an interesting experiment, but nothing different from the experiments in 5.2 and, in my opinion, slightly oversold.
