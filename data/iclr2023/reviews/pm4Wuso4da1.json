A convolutional neural network is used to perform this regression, and it is tested on real data (4 USA basin rivers).\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strenghs:\n- the application is of importance\n- the input data, which comes from real measurement, is of large size and a specific reduction was performed to treat it\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n- the paper does not present in the introduction a state-of-the-art in modelling (data driven and not data-driven) of watershed gauged streamflow, nor a literature on water levels estimation (such as rivers) from machine learning.\n- the paper does not compare its results with other techniques, or at least a baseline \n- I am not certain how the splitting between train and test was made; it should be clarified. If the splitting is done randomly, there is an over fitting problem: nearby days might have the same behavior. We would need to separate the data of different years, in order to see if we are able to make the model work in the future.\n- the machine learning model is not clearly explained, nor how it was chosen. Moreover, I think the technique does not show a novelty which would make it appropriate for the ICLR community.\n\nTypos and small remarks:\n-  'ongoing western United States drought' --> not clear, will depend on when the reader reads it, please clarify the dates\n- 'Noah': please add a citation\n- 'the network that has random numbers associated with each layer and node of the network' --> no, the weights are optimized based on the data so they are not random after training.\n- 'a variant of stochastic gradient descent' --> please indicate which one\n- 6 epochs is usually too small. This means that you should probably reduce your learning rate.\n- 'it is applies'\n- 'One study used NLDAS data focused'",

            "summary_of_the_review": "While the problem is of interest and the data seems to be interesting, this paper is not a good fit for ICLR. Moreover, the technique is very simple, the state-of-the-art and comparison are lacking, and I am not sure about the experiments (there might be an overfitting). I would suggest to clarify this point and submit to a more water cycle applied conference or journal.\n",

They should use longer sequence data in experiments.\n\u2022\tThey should compare the performance of the proposed model with other popular methods such as EA-LSTM, PGRNN and etc.\n\u2022\tThey should design different experiment settings to test the robustness of the proposed model.\n",
