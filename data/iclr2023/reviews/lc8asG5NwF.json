Geometric characteristics like Riemannian metric and the Christoffel symbols serve as parameters of the proposed linear regression model. For the special case using squared loss, the authors established asymptotic bounds on the bias and variance of the estimator. Some intuitive results are shown through numerical experiments on unit spheres, spirals, and taxi trip duration. ",

A general framework is presented that captures the common situations of (1) observations are distances, (2) observations are binary indicating if two points are similar or not, or (3) observations are triplets where one pair is more similar than others. It is then proposed to estimate the Riemannian metric through a local Taylor expansion. This is demonstrated to work well on fairly simple low-dimensional problems.",

It would be nice with a clarification on that.\n* As far as I can tell, Eq. 3.10 relies on Euclidean distances through the kernel functions. The main motivation of the work is that we should not trust the Euclidean distance, so if my reading is correct, then this seems a bit problematic.\n* I was unable to determine how geodesics were computed in practice.\n* The paper contains some simple toy experiments to verify that the method works and an application to travel times in Manhattan. While these experiments are nice, I miss a compelling application of the method. I believe that this line of work can be quite useful, but it would be good to demonstrate this to a greater degree.\n* I miss a more careful investigation in the synthetic experiments. For example, in the sphere example, it should be trivial to vary the sphere dimensionality and ask, \"does the method keep working?\" Given that only very low-dimensional problems are considered, I worry that the method does not scale. It would be nice with some evidence to counter such a belief.\n* The discussion section of the paper feels very rushed. Perhaps this is the usual time pressure of conference deadlines.",

This additional information includes a (noisy) measure of similarity between the given points in a pairwise fashion. Examples of this information includes the geodesic distance, or a binary response about the similarity of types, or a binary response about relative comparison. \n\nThe formulation relies on a formula for the intrinsic distance between corresponding points on two geodesics shot from the same base p.  This formula approximates the said distance using the Euclidean chords, Riemannian metric tensor, and the Christoffel symbols. The first term computes the Riemannian metric between the shooting vectors and the second term accounts for the curvature of the metric. The paper seizes on this linear approximation and sets up a regression problem for estimating these matrices from the given data. In this way, it estimates the metric tensors and the Christoffel symbol at point p. \n\nThe paper illustrates this solution on two simulated data (a unit sphere and a points on double spirals) and one real data set (time take by taxis between points in New York City.

I understand the taxi example but I can\u2019t think of too many other situations. \n\n\u2022\tIt seems strange that the nonlinearity of the manifold is being learnt through a linear system of equations. \n\n\u2022\tThe experiments are limited in scope. There are two simulation experiments \u2013 one on a unit sphere and one on spiral curves. The third example uses time of travel by taxis.
