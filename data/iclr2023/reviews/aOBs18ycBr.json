The idea is based on training a teacher-student network paid to predict pseudo-labels for the target domain. Laplacian adjustment then is used to improve the prediction accuracy.

            "summary_of_the_review": "The area of domain adaptation and its instantiations such as source-free formulation is an overcrowded field with many existing works. Hence, simply proposing a new algorithm is not enough. It should be demonstrated that the proposed method is addressing a challenge that existing methods do not address and outperforms existing methods significantly.  Or, a deeper theoretical understanding must be offered. However:\n\n1. The claim that \"the standard evaluation protocol only considers a narrow set of shifts in computer vision tasks\" is not necessarily true. DomainNet dataset is proposed for exactly the same reason and it has many domains, some with large gaps.\n\n2. The paper has performed experiments on a new dataset. This is great but it makes evaluation difficult. The proposed algorithm should be run on 5-6 comment benchmarks, e.g., Office-Home and DomainNet, that most works in this area use to enable comparison. Currently, the comparison is done with a small number of algorithms. It is not clear how well the proposed method will perform compared to other works not used for comparison. It is also not clear how well the proposed method will work on common benchmarks. For these reasons, I cannot judge how competitive the proposed method is.\n\n3. Experiments should include supervised training on the target domain to enable seeing how challenging the tasks are.\n\n4. The ideas of using Laplacian regularization or teacher-student networks for domain adaptation are not new and have been used in several prior works.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this work is not ready for publication and only is a good start.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper tackles the problem of source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), where a pre-trained source model is adapted using unlabeled target domain data without accessing any source domain data. While previous SFDA algorithms only considered a narrow set of domain shifts in computer vision tasks, the authors put them on a new set of more challenging naturally-occurring scenarios with extreme covariate and label shifts. They propose a new benchmark dataset based on focalized and passive recordings of bird songs. Interestingly, they show that previous SFDA methods underperform in the new dataset. To propose a more generalizable SFDA method, the authors propose NOTELA which enhances the Noisy Student Teacher with a Laplacian Adjustment. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- I like the idea of evaluating the previous SFDA methods on a new set of more challenging naturally-occurring scenarios. I do agree that they should be also working well on other datasets unless they leverage techniques specifically applicable to the computer vision domain. \n- I\u2019m not familiar with the audio datasets. However, it seems the proposed audio dataset contains naturally occurring extreme covariates and label shifts. It will provide a good testbed for developing more generalizable SFDA methods.\n- I also like how the authors deal with the hyperparameter selection in SFDA. Previous works often neglect the difficulty of the hyperparameter selection and violate the assumption of the unavailability of labeled target data. In contrast, the authors use one dataset for validation and fix the hyperparameters for the other datasets.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The authors stated that their insight for the proposed NOTELA is that they can leverage the model\u2019s feature space as another \u201csource of truth\u201d. However, in my view, the motivation does not seem new and it has been the common motivation for numerous previous SFDA methods (Ex. Yang et al., Exploiting the intrinsic neighborhood structure for source-free domain adaptation, NeurIPS 2021.). They assume that the feature space forms meaningful clusters and rely on the clusters to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled target data. It would be nice if the authors can provide more specific motivations and insights for the proposed model.\n- The proposed NOTELA encourages the nearby points in the feature space to be assigned similar pseudo-labels. Specifically, they define an affinity score between samples using the number of mutual k-nearest neighbors. I think NOTELA holds great similarities with NRC proposed in the previous work (Yang et al., Exploiting the intrinsic neighborhood structure for source-free domain adaptation, NeurIPS 2021.). In essence, NRC also defined local affinity with reciprocal nearest neighbors within the feature space and encourage label consistency among data with high local affinity. Please look into the work and explain how the NOTELA is different. Considering the similarities, I think NRC should be also included in all the experiments as a baseline.\n- The authors claim that NOTELA is a more generalizable method for SFDA methods. Even though they evaluated the proposed method in some computer vision datasets, they are not widely used datasets for evaluating SFDA methods. To claim that NOTELA is also better in computer vision datasets, I recommend using more widely used vision datasets for evaluating SFDA methods (e.g. OfficeHome and VISDA-C).\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\nThe paper was generally clear and easy to follow.\n\nQuality\nI think the paper holds good quality. It presents new datasets for evaluating SFDA methods and demonstrates empirical justifications for their motivation and proposed method.\n\nNovelty\nThe originality of the work is questionable. I think NOTELA holds great similarities with NRC proposed in the previous work (Yang et al., NeurIPS 2021)\n\nReproducibility\nThe paper seems to provide enough details to reproduce their experiments. I also expect the authors to open-source their codes in the future for better reproducibility.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While the paper has its merits, unfortunately, it also has several issues which need to be addressed: (1) unclear motivations for the proposed method, (2) questionable novelty due to the similarities between NOTELA and NRC, and (3) more widely used vision datasets for evaluating SFDA methods.",

Specifically, the authors study the task of adapting from focal to passive recordings of wild bird vocalizations for multi-label audio classification. The authors find some SFDA baselines underperform the non-adapted model in the considered task, which motivates them to propose the method NOTELA. NOTELA is based on the noisy student framework and involves two extra terms: encouraging soft prediction and Laplacian regularization. Experiments on the audio task demonstrate NOTELA outperforms other SFDA methods. Experiments on several vision benchmarks also show the efficacy of NOTELA.",

The self-training framework and the neighborhood consistency term are reasonable and effective.\n3. Implementation details are provided for good reproducibility.\n\n### <Weaknesses>\n1. The proposed method lacks novelty and seems a combination of techniques in previous works. The dropout-based noisy student is the same as [A] as agreed by the authors. The other part in NOTELA, i.e., the Laplacian regularization term, is very similar to the neighborhood regularization of target data in [B, C]. \n2. The proposed method requires carefully tuning many hyper-parameters including $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$ in Eq. (2). Although the authors use another labeled domain for validation, the condition is not always available and it is common that different target domains prefer different hyper-parameters in realistic scenarios.\n3. The problem setting and considered baselines are not clear and even confusing. The authors claim that they consider SFDA under complex distribution shifts with both covariate shifts and label shifts. However, the paper did not consider any popular vision benchmarks to verify the proposed method, including CIFAR10 with curated label shift for domain adaptation under label shift and CIFAR10 with curated label shift, Office-Home, VisDA, DomainNet, and WILDS for SFDA. In addition, the considered baselines are not competitive, even the most up-to-date SHOT and TENT are SFDA works of two years ago.

It is not surprising that the methods underperform on this task. \n\n* The creation of domain gap does not seem to be systematic - atleast from the perspective of vision methods. In case of target domain, a sample recording seems to contain multiple birds as opposed to a single bird; while the source domain only has a single bird in the dataset. This does not translate well to methods proposed in vision domain since many of these baseline methods were tested on single class. \n\n* The paper does not seem to compare with more advanced source-free methods that were developed for noise from different classes. There has been some recent work in computer vision literature that tries to induce artificial noise by mixing information from different classes.
