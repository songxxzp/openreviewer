The original problem is NP-complete, and previous methods have not been successful with even moderate-sized graphs, but the new method (sRASL) can deal with up to 100 nodes.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "UPDATE: Since the authors have added the references and explained the reasoning behind other choices, I will revise my score upwards.\n\n----\n\nA clear strength is the improvement in the speed of discovering these underlying structures, which is impressive.\n\nThere are several weaknesses, however.  First, a significant part of the literature on causal discovery in time series is entirely omitted.  A short list (I am sure it is not exhaustive) would include Granger (1969), Chu and Glymour (2008), Entner and Hoyer (2010), Malinsky and Spirtes (2018), Jabbari et al. (2017) and Gerhardus and Runge (2020).  I would also expect to see a comparison of the method to at least one other state-of-the-art discovery algorithm, rather than to a worse incarnation of the method in the paper.\n\nSecond, the graph is assumed to be first order Markov without instantaneous effects, and the under-sampling assumed to be at a fixed integer; there is no reason to believe that either of these assumptions will hold in a real problem.  \n\nThird, there is no real data application.  This is not necessarily a problem, but given that the motivation focuses very strongly on fMRI data and the paper claims that this new algorithm ought to be able to handle such data, I was disappointed not to see it applied.\n\n### References\n\nChu, T. and Glymour, C.

If these things can be explained to my satisfaction, then I would be happy to raise my score.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n1. The comparison at the end of section 2 is slightly unfair, since you take the longest computation from RASL and then give its sRASL counterpart.  You could presumably give the longest computation from sRASL and then say what its RASL counterpart was!\n\n2. Similarly, the comment on page 9 ('except for high undersamplings') sounds wrong, given that you only use a maximum undersampling of 4; this is far lower than the 20 you describe as being likely in fMRI data.\n\n### Typos\n - throughout: many `\\cite` (or `\\citet`) commands should be replaced by `\\citep`.\n - page 1: 'importantly incorrect' - this is a strange choice of phrase.\n - page 2: the references for PAGs and MAGs appear to be the wrong way around.\n - page 4: 'Section4.3' $\\to$ 'Section 4.3'.\n - page 5: 'In order to incorporate Equation 5 in Listing 1': this comment comes out of the blue, and no mention of the equations in Appendix C has previously been made.\n - page 9: 'tool in the scientists\u2019 policy-makers\u2019 toolboxes' - is there a missing word here?\n - pages 10-11: please ensure that your references are consistent and that the capitalization is correct.",

It assumes the presence of a compressed graph which can, asymptotically, be learned from time-series data and the objective is to identify all the causal graphs that are compatible with the compressed graph at some sampling rate. Thus, the authors propose an algorithm, sRASL, which reformulates a search-based algorithm, RASL by (Plis et al., 2015), along with additional structural insights into a constraint satisfaction problem. Experimental evaluation shows a clear advantage of the proposed algorithm over the search-based approach.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: The evaluation of the proposed algorithm shows a significant speedup compared to RASL and thus provides a clear advantage in terms of scalability.\n\nWeaknesses & comments:\n1- Source of undersampled graph H: The authors state the following:\n> sRASL algorithm takes as input a (potentially) undersampled graph H, whether learned from data D, expert domain knowledge, a combination of the two, or some other source.\n\nIt is understandable to make such an assumption whenever there are theoretical guarantees that a compressed graph can be asymptotically learned from data. If such a result is known in the literature, it should be made clear in the text. However, it sounds unlikely that such a structure can be fully learnable as is the case with PAGs (Zhang, 2008).\n\n2- Evaluation: There is no comparison of the performance of sRASL and the work of (Hyttinen et al., 2017). I understand that the latter assumes the undersampling rate is known but a comparison is possible by running \"the method sequentially for all possible u\".\n\n3- Citation confusion: The citations on page 2 regarding the works of MAGs and PAGs are incorrect. The work of (Richardson & Spirtes, 2002) presents the theoretical formulation of ancestral graphs where MAGs are a special case. However, MAGs are not learnable from data. Zhang (2008) builds on this work by Spirtes and others to formulate a complete learning algorithm, the output of which is a PAG. The cited work by Zhang is for inference applied on top of PAGs; a more suitable citation is the one below.\n\nZhang, J. (2008).
