Within this framework, categorical and binary features are modeled using multinomial diffusion, and, completely independently, numerical features are modeled using Gaussian diffusion.  The model is compared to several recent deep generative models on the task of \"Train on fake, test on real (TFTR)\" [1] across different datasets considering the average of five classification/regression algorithms and, separately, Catboost.\n\n[1] Jordon, James, Jinsung Yoon, and Mihaela Van Der Schaar. \"PATE-GAN: Generating synthetic data with differential privacy guarantees.\" International conference on learning representations. 2018.",

Consider a categorical feature, \"Name,\" and a numerical feature, \"Name_length.\"  Your model could not learn, or even approximate, this deterministic relationship.  Corresponding synthesized data will also be incorrect.\n\n-\"Each categorical feature is handled by a separate forward diffusion process, i.e., the noise components for all features\nare sampled independently.\" <- Same criticism as above\n\n-The authors state the utility of their method for privacy.  But the two aforementioned deficiencies render synthetic data incorrect, e.g., synthetic data may disrespect even obvious correlations.\n\n-Why is baseline SMOTE used?  Other variants, like SVM SMOTE, are reported to work much better.\n\n-Only TVAE is compared to.  However, CTGAN should also be considered,\nas it's source is open (it is the package as TVAE, the CTGAN package)\nand is the main synthesizer (TVAE was developed as a competitor in the\nCTGAN paper).\n\n-The paper lacks a large amount of important details.  E.g.: 1) \"Smote... we generalize it\" <- How? (2) Details for utilized software, both implementation (SMOTE) and version (sklearn), are lacking from the paper.\n\n-\"we evaluate ML efficiency only with respect\nto the CatBoost model (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018), which is the leading GBDT implementation\nproviding state-of-the-art performance on tabular tasks\" <- Please say\n\"arguably is the leading...,\" as XGBoost is more widely used and also\nprovides SOTA GBDT performance.\n\n-No discussion on the runtime (training and synthesis) of TabDDPM.",

This point is vague until well into the paper.\n\nQuality\n--------\nThe quality of the paper has significant room for improvement.  Firstly, by including CTGAN (which is widely regarded as the SOTA GAN tabular data synthesizer) and higher performing versions of SMOTE as benchmark competitors.

We have structure in image and NLP and the CNN is using this feature as a biased into the architecture. On the other hand, as stated in many tabular data papers, including SubTab [NeurIPS 2021] and VIME [NeurIPS 2020], and etc, the main problem of tabular data is that it does not have structure or the structured is not obvious as other domains. \n\nApart from that, the proposed method is not novel and the experiments are not convincing. \n\nThe number of features is too small in all experiments.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes TabDDPM, a diffusion model for generic tabular data consisting of both continuous and discrete features. The paper compares TabDDPM to existing VAE and GAN methods, and against a simple SMOTE baseline. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\nI think the overall motivation for the paper is good. It is often the case that generative models are specialized to particular media, and can be unsuitable out-of-the-box for generic tabular data. \n\nThe experimental results mainly highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of SMOTE as a baseline, beating both the VAE and GAN approaches. This is a useful observation. \n\n**Weaknesses**\nWhile demonstrating the strong SMOTE baseline is useful, it also highlights that the proposed method only matches this baseline. I'm also not sure about the comparison to SMOTE on sensitive data, both in terms of the metric used, and whether fitting generative models on sensitive data is a useful idea. The latter is discussed below, but in terms of the DCR metric, surely this only captures one possible vector of attack for a potential adversary? That is, a comprehensive comparison of privacy preservation in this setting would go beyond a simple proximity check, and instead marginalize over a number of possible attack vectors? \n\nFor a stronger baseline beyond SMOTE, I would have thought the authors would try a model which factorizes the continuous and discrete (non-ordinal) features. That is, train one model on the continuous features (e.g. a standard diffusion model), and then another model for the discrete features conditioned on the continuous features (e.g. a conditional autoregressive model), or vice versa. This would exploit the state-of-the-art generative models for both modalities, and would provide a strong baseline for a model trained on all features jointly to beat. Moreover, the statement 'In contrast, larger DCR values indicate that the generative model can produce something \u201cnew\u201d rather than just copies of real data.' seems far too strong in that (i) it argues that the data and model capacity are sufficient to recover something close to the 'true' distribution, and (ii) DCR is a sufficient metric to determine this. \n\nI may be unfamiliar with common practice, but I'm not sure that I buy the arguments regarding sensitive data and privacy. In particular, if data is sensitive enough to not be shared, training classification/regression models etc. on that data is itself a tricky task, potentially introducing issues of bias, fairness, etc., not to mention generic failure cases. To me, adding the extra step of first fitting a generative model to the data, which is then used to create synthetic data for input to the rest of the pipeline, only exacerbates these potential issues. For example, even though diffusion models have seen impressive breakthroughs in image generation, using diffusion models to generate e.g. medical scans for the purpose of enhancing a disease-detection model seems highly questionable. \n\nFinally, when judging the performance of the proposed method, Figure 2 seems to just visualize a selection of the marginal feature distributions. This seems lacking, in that (i) the evaluation is qualitative, and (ii) surely we're primarily interested in judging the model's capacity to model the joint dependencies in the data correctly? ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "**Clarity**\nThe method is fairly cleanly described and presented. The relation to previous work on Gaussian and multinomial diffusion is clear, as well as the comparison to previous work based on VAEs and GANs. \n\n**Originality**\nI'm broadly familiar with the generative modeling literature, but less familiar with the specific problem of generative modeling for tabular data. The proposed method seems to be a novel combination and application of existing diffusion methods for continuous and discrete data. The comparison of previous methods to a strong baseline is also highlighted as novel, and I appreciate that this is included.",
