For each part of the algorithm, the authors provide the motivation and mention the counterpart in vision methods.    \n2.\tThe proposed method is simple and has good performance. The method does not include many tricks, but a rather original implementation of the principled self-supervised learning method. It is encouraging to see it works well on tabular data, across various datasets and settings.    \nWeaknesses:    \n1.\tDespite the good performance, I\u2019m also curious to see the contribution of each part of the model. How does loss function affect the performance? What if you use the VCIReg loss? How does the queue affect the performance? If you remove the queue and use large batchsize following SimCLR, or simply use Simsiam, what will happen? It would be better if the authors include them as an ablation study.\n",

The novelty is limited to empirical application to tabular data.\n2. The paper does not seem to have compared against many similar methods it mentioned (SwAV for instance).
