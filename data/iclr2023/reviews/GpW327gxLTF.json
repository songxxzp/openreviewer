In particular, the authors design a series of experiments to explain the counterintuitive finding where the forecasting model performs better in a univariate setting. I have several questions listed below:\n\n1. It's unclear why the authors don't use the traditional multivariate forecast setting with univariate models. Is it because of the computation cost?\n2. How is one single univariate model trained on all the individual dimensions? Some details are needed here. \n3. What are the loss functions used to train the model? A shape-aware loss function (e.g., DILATE) or point-wise distance-based loss functions (e.g., MSE, MAE, etc.)? The latter type of function may cause the model to fail to capture the shape of the time series, which I think could be another potential reason why the univariate setting sometimes outperforms the multivariate setting.

They show that this simple approach is empirically efficent on various tasks in different situations. The authors also try to measure the interaction between the channels during the forcasting process to understand the prediction. First, they simply quantify the impact of the number of channel by repeated random channel sampling experiments. Then they propose a gradient based method to quantify all single interactions.\nStrong refererences are chosen to establish baseline performances on classical multivariate datasets and the comparison is interesting: multivariate models fail on data with low interactions between channels and succeed on Illness.\nThen the authors propose to measure the data requirements of the different pipelines. Without surprise, the gap between simpler univariate approaches and more complex multivariate model increase when the dataset is reduced.",
