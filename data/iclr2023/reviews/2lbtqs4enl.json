            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method for the problem of 2D to 3D pose lifting. The authors propose to divide the all joints of a pose into several groups, and then use separate networks to lift each group of joints independently. A recombining network then takes as input the features of lifting networks and estimates the full 3D pose. The above grouping strategy is applied to the unsupervised 2D-to-3D pose lifting task. Experiments are implemented on two datasets, and the results show that the split-and-recombine method significantly outperforms the full pose lifting method using the same backbone model, and also performs better than unsupervised SOTAs. When trained on HUMAN3.6M and tested on MPI-INF-3DHP, the proposed method outperforms most of supervised and weakly-supervised competitors. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \n- Experimental results are promising, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed split-and-recombine strategy. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- Novelty is relatively limited. Divide-and-conquer is a common approach in computer vision. It is interesting to observe that joint grouping can improve the accuracy significantly. But I expect more in this work. For example, the authors could investigate novel methods to decently encourage the interaction between joins belonging to one group and suppress the interaction between joins belonging to different groups, in order to improve the efficiency.\n- In my understanding, the proposed method should be applicable for all 2D-to-3D pose lifting methods. Why do the authors only focus on the unsupervised one? What about the experimental results on supervised and weakly-supervised methods?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a study investigating the influence of different representations of 2D key points to regress 3D depth in an unsupervised fashion. The hypothesis studied is that when the whole 2D skeleton is input into a lifting network, the network extracts undesirable correlations between key points, which hurt performance. The most successful proposed model splits key points into two groups (torso and legs) and regresses depth individually for each group. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* The paper designs a limited, small-scale study to evaluate a single design aspect of human pose regression networks in a controlled way. As such, the paper can vary factors individually and study the outcomes on reprojection error. \n* The paper is overall well-written and easy to understand. I have some points regarding improving readability/clarity below.\n* The paper studies the problem on two different datasets. The Human3.6M dataset is used to study the accuracy of the model on the training/testing dataset. The second dataset, MPI-INF-3DHP, is used to study generalization.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper mentioned that their proposed input modality (split torso/leg groups) can be used as drop-in replacements to improve existing approaches that use full-body key points as input. However, there is no experiment in this paper that shows this to be true. In my opinion, this is an over-generalization and should be validated. As the paper tries to encourage the use of a different input form through a controlled study,  I think the paper could be made much stronger by showing evidence that the proposed method improves performance for one of the multiple state-of-the-art models. In my opinion, this should be rather easy to validate and will add a lot to the paper. \n* The paper mentions multiple times that the proposed 3D pose representation is \"optimal\", implying that there can be no other representation that is better. As there is no evidence to support this claim, please remove it. Instead, the paper could refer to it as: \"improved 2D representation\".\n* Figure 1: It is unclear to me what this figure shows. What are the colors representing? And how can the paper claim to see a clear correlation between the two selected joints? Explain more, please. \n* Section 6. The paper mentions that their paper is truly unsupervised and therefore it is not entirely clear when to stop training. However, the method does NEED ground truth 2D poses to train the GAN and therefore is not fully unsupervised and this argumentation is not well supported. If 2D ground truth poses are not available, how would you train your discriminator? If this is not possible, why not just use a portion of the data for validation? In my opinion, this space could be better used by showing that the proposed approach benefits existing methods too. \n\nMinor concerns:\n* Section 3.1: the paper mentions ordinates instead of coordinates. Maybe a search/replace error?\n* Table 2 caption: uses transfer learning during from...",
