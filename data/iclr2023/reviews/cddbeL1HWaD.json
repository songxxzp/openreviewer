            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper demonstrates that current methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) do not suffice for a scenario where communication between agents is possible--but only in a subset of the state space. For a case of two agents, it proposes a method of training MARL agents via a two-stage process of first learning a policy that will enable communication and then learning an optimal policy starting from a communication-enabling state. The method successfully learns to enable cooperative problem solving in a simple environment.\n\nNote: I previously reviewed this paper as a NeuRIPS submission.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "+ Interesting problem\n+ Novel approach of separating discovery and utilization, which seems justified\n+ Thoughtful choice of combination of learning methods\n- Only applied to two agents (show an example with more agents)\n- States that the number of iterations in discovery stage is a \"tuning parameter\", but doesn't give any easy way to adjust this other than trial and error.  (Give more guidance how to set number of iterations, e.g. provide a testing procedure for whether sufficiently many iterations has been reached, or comment on such a possibility.) [after rebuttal: authors are looking into this]",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "# Quality\nThe combination of OBL and DIAL is technically novel. It is interesting that OBL is used specifically due to its inability to form a protocol (as to avoid forming an inappropriate protocol in the early stages.)  It would have been very interesting to extend to more agents, but only two agents are considered here. The two examples include cost and noise parameters to provide more illustration of the method.\n\n# Clarity\nThe paper is generally written clearly.\n\n# Originality\nThe problem of learning to communicate when very deliberate actions are needed to enable communication does not seem to be studied in the literature. There exist environments in the literature where communication is bounded by spatial constraints, but where it is relatively easy for agents to accidentally enter communication-enabling states. But it seems rather more realistic to assume that communication is difficult, and this work considers that possibility.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This is an interesting paper for the MARL field. There is currently a disconnect between the real-world (where communication may be limited) and MARL scenarios which make strong assumptions on the possibility of communication. This paper raises the interesting question of what can be done when communication is difficult. Furthermore, if the question of how to enable communication are further investigated, this might have implications for theories of the socio-biological origins of culture and language.\n\nThus, I recommend acceptance.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a method for agents to learn how to communicate using free communication channels, named \"cheap talk channels\". The problem is divided into two separate problems, namely to discover cheap talk and to utilize cheap talk. There is a communication space, separate from the environment action space. Not all states allow communication, so an agent can communicate only if it gets to a state that allows communication. The method proposed is base on maximizing mutual information. Since discovery is separate from utilization, when agents discover a communication channel, they do need to learn how to use the communication channel. To learn how to utilize the communication channel, the agent use DIAL, an existing method to learn efficiently communication protocols. The experimental work covered in the paper is done for a problem where the agents have to discover phone booths before learning how to use them to communicate.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: the formalization of the problem to learn how to  communicate is divided in two separate steps, which simplifies the learning process.\nWeaknesses: the specific problem of discovery phone booths and learning how to communicate seems artificially complex.

The setting of the problem seems to be artificial, designed for the purpose of using existing methods, OBL and DIAL.",

Readers need to be already familiar with them. The novelty seems limited to the decomposition of the problem in two steps. The use of mutual information is not novel, but is likely novel in he specific context described. Reproducibility is not clear. There is pseudo-code for the method, but I am not sure it will be obvious how to produce code from it. There is no indication of the availability of the software.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Authors design and implement an algorithm that operates under fewer assumptions than some communication-based MARL works. Agents learn to discover which environment actions and communicative actions to take, so as to maximize the mutual information (MI) with respect to observation at the receiver's end. The proposed CTDUL outperforms several baselines in the phone booth maze environment.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Paper addresses a well-defined niche by relaxing a set of common assumptions found in some communication-based MARL methods. The tested evaluation environment is intuitive. Claims made with an intuitive approach (MI maximization) are shown to function correctly in the empirical evaluation.\n\nA number of factors can make the paper much stronger: problem positioning, clarified definition (especially action and channel), varied environments, better justified baseline choice, and comments on computation overhead.\n\nWhile the problem addressed is clearly an interesting setting, real-world settings might question its practicality. If the communication channels are not even known a priori, could there really be multiple agents who happen to have access to the same channels and also coincidentally need to cooperate? Consider a swarm of drones. If one common administrator is operating all of those drones as in a search-and-rescue operation, it is almost always the case that their communication channels are known pre-dispatch. On the other hand, if different operators are managing each of those drones as in individual drone racing competitions, then it may well be the case that there simply is no need for cooperative/coordinated flight management. It feels as though the removal of assumptions inadvertently led to a less realistic problem setting, so a better problem positioning could more effectively highlight the significance of the proposed solution to the problem.\n\nCommunicative actions and channels could be defined more clearly. If the term \"channels\" are correctly aligned with the same term in the radio communications sense, then communicative actions being \"hint up\" or \"hint down\" can be a misinterpretation of communication. Instead, should the concepts of channels remain faithful to radio communications literature, then the problem of which channels to discover should also pertain to the communication channels, such as which bandwidths. The current formulation of A_comm is probably more aptly described as message encoding since the chosen action answers the question of \"which message should be sent\". However, if this indeed is the case, then CTDUL's A_comm would simply be hard-coded actions.\n\nIt would be a valuable addition to the paper to investigate CTDUL's performance in other environments, such as SMAC or MAMuJoCo.\n\nIt would also be an insightful curation of CTDUL's positioning to include SchedNet (ICLR 2019), which addressed medium contention and medium access constraints in MARL, and DIAYN (2018), which is an information-theoretic approach to RL exploration and then identify CTDUL's strengths, differences, and delimitation.\n\nPlease also elaborate on the cost of computing pairwise mutual information and how this affects the empirical performance of CTDUL.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\nProblem setting and definitions can be made clearer and can help in making a much stronger case for the paper's main arguments.\n\nQuality\nCurrent set of chosen baselines makes it difficult to assess the quality of the proposed model. More immediate competitors should be tested under more varied environments. Comments on PMI computation should accompany evaluation results. On a different note, the heatmap should probably be explained in more detail since it may not be the most conventional visual aid in related literature.\n\nOriginality\nMutual information maximization is not a novel training objective. It is difficult to evaluate the novelty of A_comm since it can be better clarified. OBL is also an independent previous work. Put together, groundbreaking novelty might not be the paper's appeal, but the structured combination of PMI and OBL does work well in harshly limited settings.",
