            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper addresses the problem of novel view synthesis from a set of input images. The authors presented a point-based method which is build on top of exsiting works on differentiable point-based rendering. They introduced point sculpting for pruning and adding points to improve the photo-consistency and completness of the reconstruction. They also exploited sphereical harmnonics in high-dimensionalpoint feature space to capture non-Lambertain visual effects. They proposed a point dropout layer that can significantly improves the generalization to novel views. Experimental results show that their method can achieve better visual quality than the popular NeRF approach and at the same time being 100 times faster in rendering speed.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n+ The proposed point sculpting can effectively improve the completness of the reconstruction.\n+ The proposed point dropout layer can alleviate the over-fitting problem by giving all points a chane to get optimized even if they are covered by others in the input views.\n+ The proposed high-dimensional spherical harmonics point features can effectively capture non-Lamberian visual effects.\n+ The proposed method is 100 times faster than the popular NeRF approach in rendering.\n+ The proposed method can produce better visual quality than NeRF and other point-based methods.\n+ The proposed method achieves SOTA in terms of SSIM and LPIPS metrics.\n+ The proposed method allows easy fine-grained scene editing due to its point-based representation.\n\nWeaknesses\n- Examples in the Appendix show that the proposed method is good at capturing complex textures and strong non-Lambertian effects, but tends to produce over-smoothed results for tiny structures. This may suggest that the proposed spherical harmonics point features are effective in modeling the view-dependent appearance of the scene but the point-based representation may not be good (dense) enough to  capture fine scene geometry. The over-smoothed results may also be related to the use of U-Net for final rendering. Finally, the averaging of 2 results generated from 2 random point subsets may also contribute to the problem. More analysis should be carried out regarding this issue.\n- In 3.2, it was mentioned that U-Net was employed to convert the 2D feature map F of a target veiw into RGB image. However, in 4.2 (point adding step), it was mentioned that the point features were treated directly as RGB values during rasterization without using U-Net in optimizing the existing point.  Please clarify how can the features be treated directly as RGB values in this step.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Overall this paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The proposed point sculpting, though sounds a bit engineering, is effective in improving the completness of the reconstruction. The proposed point dropout layer is also sound and novel, and is effective in improving the generalization to novel views. SOTA results have been reported. Sufficient details have been provided for reproduction of the results.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a point-based rendering framework for novel view synthesis. The method starts with an initial point cloud estimation from MVS systems. With the proposed key technique named point sculpting, the framework is less prone to initial point cloud error and could add and remove points within the optimization process. The method uses point rasterization instead of volume rendering when synthesizing novel views. The paper includes extensive experiments showing good results.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n- The proposed point sculpting technique is novel. The method achieves good performance on all benchmarked datasets and has faster training and inference speed when compared to NeRF or other point-based baselines.\n\n- Using spherical harmonics in the feature space and eliminating the need for a dir encoding MLP seems to be a novel but useful technique.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- According to Appendix B.2, the authors applied different MVS networks (at least different weights) when evaluating on different datasets. Especially, when evaluating on LLFF data, they finetune the MVS model scene-by-scene. This may cause concern/confusion because 1) the time for COLMAP and scene-by-scene fine-tuning should be taken into account when comparing, rendering the method less efficient for these scenes; 2) it is unclear why not using COLMAP point clouds directly. The authors should clarify these and ideally use a same generalized MVS model for a fair comparison.\n\n- Pulsar is a very related direct baseline of this method. However, a comparison with Pulsar seems to be missing in this paper.\n\n- The intuition behind employing a U-Net for rendering is unclear. Is it possible to use per-pixel MLP to render the features (MLP: feat -> RGB)? Is the U-Net pre-trained and weight-shared across datasets?",

In which step do we turn feature vector to actual SH coefficient and compute the radiance? \n\n3. Point Dropout Layer: Will random subsets cause flickering in different views?
