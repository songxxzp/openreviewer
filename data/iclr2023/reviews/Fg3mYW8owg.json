However, most of the experiments only consider blur kernel, SR and noises. They are not sufficient enough to validate the advantages of the proposed method over existing arts. Since these degradations can be easily simulated and the settings are easily treated as GT to be learned from a network and used in the following SR network (as explicit degradation). More complicated degradations should be considered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n2.

It would much better if the paper first present a mathematical formulation of the problem (the training, the loss functions, the goals), and later present the architecture and the details about the modules. In the current formulation is extremely hard to distill the ideas and understand what is new and what is not.\n2. All the results are with benchmarks that use simulated degradations.

I would like to see also results on real images (not from a benchmark). For example results on any image of the Open Image Dataset and a visual comparison in terms of artifacts (since no metric will be available).\n\nAfter Rebuttal.\nThe authors addressed the concerns raised during the first round of reviews, and updated the manuscript accordingly.

This paper proposes a method to learn an implicit degradation model leveraging learned representation in a teacher-student model.

Experiments show comparable or better performance than some existing models on commonly used datasets.

This paper proposes to learn an implicit degradation model by leveraging a previously known method called knowledge distillation in a teacher-student setup. \n\n***Experiments***\n\nThe experiments are comprehensive and provide comparable or better performance than compared methods. The proposed method is computationally efficient in general. \n\nExperiments on various datasets with different degradation models show promising results. \n\nThe authors demonstrate generalization to several degradations which is an important highlight of this work. \n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nThe main idea is an amalgamation of previously known methods, such as knowledge distillation and efficient super-resolution using GANs.\n\nThe loss function consists of standard objective functions with several regularization parameters. The authors should address how to tune all these parameters in large-scale real-world blind super-resolution tasks.\n\nTable 3: Are the compared methods really the state-of-the-art for real-world SR on AIM19 and NTIRE2020?\n\nIn the literature, the results of DASR on AIM19 are reported to be better than the results obtained by the proposed method KDSR. In my opinion, the authors should clarify how the compared methods are SOTA, maybe in terms of the training procedure, e.g., paired or unpaired learning or appropriate metrics to make a proper assessment of the baselines. \n\nThere is a disparity between the perceptual metrics, such as FID and LPIPS of popular SR methods including DASR (also the winner of AIM19 challenge FSSR) and the distortion metrics, such as PSNR and SSIM. As a result, there is a trade-off between perceptual and distortion quality. I wonder whether the disparity exists in the proposed method KDSR. If yes, how to overcome such issues?\n\nIt is well-known that quantitative improvements in terms of PSNR and SSIM do not necessarily indicate qualitative improvements, especially for the tasks under consideration. This is evident from Table 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the main paper because most methods have similar scores. To make a fair comparison with baselines, I suggest the authors include LPIPS, FID or other image quality metrics on all the datasets.\n\nFigure 8: Are the results generated for isotropic or non-isotropic Gaussian kernels?",
