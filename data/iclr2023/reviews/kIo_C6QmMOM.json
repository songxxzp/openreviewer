            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n\n1. Main objective (to solve coupled PDEs in the regression setting) is clearly formulated.\n2. Most of the main claims are reasonably substantiated (for exceptions see below).\n3. Most ideas are clearly explained (for exceptions see below).\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. Architecture is not described in detail.\n\n    In Section 3 (page 6) authors describe neural networks A, B, C, and T used in multiwavelet neural operators as follows\n    ``In our proposed model, for each operator, the neural networks A, B, and C use single-layered convolutional neural networks while T uses a single linear layer.``\n    \n    This description is incomplete. What are the sizes of convolutions, the strides the number of input and output channels (features)? Are there any nonlinear activations and what are those? Are there multiple multiwavelet kernels (cells) involved and how many of them?\n\n2. The proposed model is a minor modification of [1].\n\n    From the description in the main text and the parameter count in Table 6 (supplementary materials), it looks like the proposed architecture is exactly the same as in [1]. The contribution then is a way how the known architecture can be applied to coupled equations.\n\n3. Awkward notation\n\n    In many places, authors use backslash / to refer the reader to distinct cases. This does not look appropriate when mathematical expressions are involved since / is also used to denote division, quotient group, and other mathematical operations.  For a concrete example see page 5, text right before equation 9.\n\n4. The first claimed contribution is unjustified.\n\n    ``For coupled differential equations, we propose a coupled neural operator learning scheme, named CMWNO. To the best of our knowledge, CMWNO is the first work using pure data-driven method to solve coupled differential equations.``\n    \n    It is not clear what the authors mean. Any work that solves the Navier-Stokes equation using machine learning deals with coupled PDEs since velocities are coupled. See [2] for a concrete example. Besides that, there are works on multiphase flows [3], weather forecasts [4], e.t.c. Essentially, there are hundreds if not thousands of papers dealing with coupled PDEs in regression and physics-informed setups.\n\n5. The choice of a physics-informed neural network (PINN) as a benchmark is questionable.\n\n    PINN provides a way to solve PDE given initial data. As the present reviewer understands vanilla PINN takes only coordinates for input and produces the solution. That is, PINN is not a neural operator in contrast with all other considered architectures. How PINN is applied precisely in this context? Is it retrained for each new input function? In the opinion of the present reviewer, PINN adds little to the understanding of how the accuracy of the presented model compares to the state-of-the-art.\n\n[1] - Gupta G, Xiao X, Bogdan P.

Multiwavelets are a generalization of standard scalar wavelets but instead use more than one scaling function and the multiwavelet transform is not a straightforward separable extension of the wavelet transform but contains interaction coefficients due to this multivariable choice. \n\nAt the other hand, in scenarios of coupled partial differential equations in which more than one differential equation needs to be solved with interacting terms, the greens function kernels are not independent and hence not amenable to be solved using well-known neural operators like PINNs, Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), etc in a straightforward manner. \n\nThe authors combine the two scenarios and propose the coupled multiwavelet neural operator (CMWNO). Experiments are demonstrated for 2 problems - Gray Scott Equations and the Mean Field Game Problem. The results show good improvements over baseline neural network approaches by a significant margin. \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths \n\n- The high-level motivation combining multiwavelets and coupled PDEs is very interesting and original (to the best of my knowledge) \n- The results are significant when compared to standard learning-based baseline methods \n\n\nWeaknesses and Questions\n\n- My main concern is the assumptions leading to equations 4 and 5. I am not fully on board with why the multiwavelet space automatically guarantees decoupling? I presume this assumption is crucial since the construction of the architecture for CMWNO is hinged on such a separation and solved in an iterative fashion (i.e. fix the coupling dependence and solve for the kernel and vice versa). Despite this, what is the need for multiwavelets at this step? and not simple wavelets or the Fourier transform?  (which can also lead to an interesting baseline) \n- Even though the improvement over shown baselines is good, I am not sure if it is a super convincing comparison since most of these approaches do not seem to be designed for coupled PDE\u2019s. I do feel that the concatenation approach to make these methods work for the coupled system is a fair attempt, but I am not too surprised they don\u2019t work well. \n- The paper focuses on coupling with only two variables. How can the proposed framework be extended for a more sophisticated coupling PDE system with many variables? especially the dice strategy? \n- Broadly, it appears that the positioning of this paper appeals more to a core PDE audience (giving them a new tool with neural networks for complex PDEs like Gray Scott equations, etc) rather than a representation learning conference. However, this paper is not entirely out of place for ICLR, but I feel that the background and motivation for coupled PDEs and Multiwavelets can be made more accessible. For example, a visual schematic, or some visualizations depicting the use cases for multiwavelets and coupled PDEs would go a long way to make everything convincingly self-contained. ",
