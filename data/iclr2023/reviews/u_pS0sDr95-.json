The model consists of\n-  multi-layer perceptron that outputs an 'energy' as a function of a latent vector\n- LSTM that generates SELFIES strings conditional on the latent vector\n- multi-layer perceptrons to predict molecule properties given latent vectors\n\nThe model is first trained on a large set of molecules and their properties. Then, it is fine-tuned to generate molecules with desired properties using a new method that the authors name 'sampling with gradual distributional shifting'.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "- As far as I know, this model architecture has not previously been used for this problem, and it gets good results on the presented metrics compared to the presented baselines.\n-  Related work is not correctly described. In section 2 '... learn a surrogate function to predict properties, and then use Bayesian optimization' is not an accurate description of the molecular swarm optimization in Winter et al. (2019) nor the simulated design-synthesis-test cycles in Segler et al. (2018).  In 3.2 and 4.2 the authors fail to note that Segler et al. (2018) also generated a very high percentage of valid SMILES strings using an LSTM. It would be a good baseline to include.\n- Langevin dynamics is notoriously slow to sample multimodal distributions. Is this a problem for MolEBM? \n- What happens to validity, novelty, and uniqueness of generated molecules after SGDS?\n- Could the model be evaluated on the GuacaMol benchmarks (Brown et al., 2019)?\n- Good scores on the presented metrics may not indicate usefulness for de novo drug design. For example, Figure 2 shows that several of the molecules corresponding to bold numbers in table 4 are not reasonable drug candidates (large cycles etc.).\n",

I think it means that points which are close together in latent space correspond to molecules with similar properties, but this should be clarified.\n- 3.3 is hard to make sense of. We are told first that y is a deterministic function of x, and then that x and y are conditionally independent given z. This can only be true if y is a deterministic function of z, but in equation (7) we\u2019re told that y has Gaussian distribution given z.  Instead, one could just say that the model fits a distribution of the form given in equation (6) to approximate p(x,y). The authors say that because the latent space is expressive, we can assume (6), but I think this argument is the wrong way round: because of the choice of model (6) and negative log-likelihood loss, the latent z is forced to encode information about y.\n- what does \u2018top-down\u2019 as in \u2018top-down generator model\u2019 mean?\n- Which molecular properties are given as regression targets during pretraining, and which are only introduced during SGDS?\n",

The latent variable are modelled using an energy based model, and the molecular structure is an LSTM neural network that generates a SELFIES string representation. Conditionaly sampling molecules with novel values of the desired properties is not likely to work well, since the generative model has not seen any training data in that region. To combat this issue, a procedure is proposed where additional data at the boundary is gradually added, and the model is finetuned.",

In order to achieve this the authors propose an energy based generative model that augments a top down generative model (conditional autoregressive model) with a latent space learnt via EBM and a property regression model for each of the properties.

Especially for unconditional generations it achieves 95.5% validity with 100% novelty using SMILES with the ZINC dataset. Moreover, the sampling with gradual distribution shifting (SGDS) is an interesting suggestion for out of distribution sampling. \n\nWeaknesses: \nThe paper is clearly written but is missing some more explanation about the sampling procedure and the theory behind it.  Even though to estimate the expirations MCMC sampling of the prior and the posterior is required the method is described as \"maximum likelihood\u201d.  \nResults are not compelling enough. Event though the model is proposed for conditional generations given desired properties in the experimental results we see results only for property optimisation. So more experiments should be added to prove the capability for conditional molecule generation like\n- experiments with properties targeted to a predefined range, providing the percent of generated molecules within the target range and the diversity\n- experiments aiming to generate new molecules with a optimised property but similar to the original molecules (similarity-constrained Optimisation)\n\nMoreover, a comparison of the generation time of the proposed model with the other models would be useful. \n\nThe authors should not bold the best values only when they correspond to your model (Table3 GCPN, MolDQN, MARS, GraphDF achieve same QED 1st with the proposed model, MARS, GraphDF achieve same QED 2nd and 3rd with the proposed model)\u2028",
