            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors proposed a rendering method for a neural radiance field. When marching on each light ray, the authors chose the sampling points using the idea of importance sampling; the samples are drawn in accordance with the contributions to the final rendered color. The method was designed so as to reduce the number of the radiance queries, which (they expected) would bring the computational advantages over the previous methods. They incorporated this sampling strategy into two baseline methods, NeRF and DIGO, and compared the performance with the original methods. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\n- The idea of importance sampling is explained well in a logical manner. As far as I read, the theory and the related derivations are correct. Moreover, this idea was successfully implemented as a trainable module that can be incorporated into the existing neural rendering methods.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n- The authors failed to establish the effectiveness (computational advantages over the previous methods) of their proposal.  As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the authors' method achieved only a small amount (up to 25 percent) of reduction in computation time  compared to the baselines (NeRF and DVGO) at the cost of quality decline. The authors should notice the fact that the number of sampling points can be changed also for the original methods (NeRF and DVGO) so as to find a desirable trade-off between the computational cost and rendering quality. However, the authors used a fixed number of samples for the baselines,  and thus, I cannot see the advantage of the authors' proposal over the baseline methods. Moreover, the authors did not compare their proposed method against other speed-up methods for neural radiance fields. For example, DONeRF achieved a significant improvement in quality-speed trade-off: 15-78 times fewer computation and comparable rendering quality than/to the baseline NeRF. KiloNeRF achieved more than 2000 times speed up while maintaining the rendering quality. Compared to these works, the contribution of the present submission seems quite limited. \n\n- Insufficient consideration/evaluation for the method's design. The proposed method was designed to reduce the number of \"radiance queries\", but it still needs many \"density queries\" to obtain accurate opacity along the light ray. Moreover, the re-parameterization for the importance sampling introduced additional computational cost. Therefore, it seems that the authors' method cannot save the computation so much as the other speed-up methods. The authors should evaluate computational cost (e.g. in FLOP per pixel) involved in each of these steps (density queries, re-parameterization, and radiance queries) to see the problem clearer. Moreover, it seems that the authors sticked to the idea of using a single radiance field, rejecting the use of auxiliary/multiple networks. However, the use of auxiliary/multiple networks has practical advantages in terms of the speed-quality trade-off.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "I found no significant problems in these respects. The paper itself is well written and easy to follow. The proposed idea is clearly presented. I think the authors made a reasonable effort to include sufficient information for reproduction.\n\nThe author' idea, the use of accurate importance sampling for a neural radiance field, is somewhat new in the sense that  I do not know the same work that has been done/published before. However, as I mentioned in \"Strength and Weaknesses\", I do not think that this idea (in the current form) is reasonable and useful for advancing the technology in this field.",

This can help decrease the number of evaluations to MLPs. This sounds reasonable. But the experiments do not meet the authors\u2019 expectations. First, decreasing the MLP evaluations should indeed improve efficiency a lot. But the results show only minor improvements on NeRF baseline. This reminds us of if the proposed approach itself slows down the efficiency. Second, DVGO is an explicit volume-based approach which is extremely efficient. I have to say the author have chosen a wrong baseline. Because the efficiency of explicit volume-based approach is not severely slow down by the great number of sampling points. Third, a big number of sampling points is vital to rendering quality. So, the rendering quality of this paper degrades. Fourth, the experiments cannot support the claim.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an importance sampling scheme for the radiance evaluation of NeRF-style volumetric rendering. Importance sampling replaces the coarse network in NeRF with direct sampling of the high resolution density field. This promises a simpler algorithm without the need for a proxy loss on the coarse network, and improved quality/performance, as radiance samples are concentrated in regions of high opacity, while transparent regions are skipped.\n\nThe paper describes the relevant background on volumetric rendering and outlines how the piecewise constant ray integral can be recast, first as a monte-carlo estimate in ray space, and then as as an integral over the normalized opacity along the ray.\n\nThe paper describes in detail how the approximate opacity is computed with a piecewise approximation, and how samples from the distribution are drawn via inverse transform sampling. A complication of the paper is that in order to construct an approximation of the cumulative density function, the technique does require a relatively fine (256) sampling of the density field, so any performance improvement of importance sampling would be gained solely by saving radiance evaluations.\n\nThere is a insightful synthetic experiment that compares the proposed integration scheme to uniform sampling in ray space (with ablations for stratified sampling).\n\nThe paper then presents comparisons to NeRF and a voxel-based technique (DVGO). It appears from these experiments that both baselines (full NeRF with coarse model, and an unguided NeRF without hierarchical sampling) perform better than the proposed technique.\n\n",

The description of the technical contribution is clear, and Figures 1-3 are good visualizations of the technique. \n\nThe outlined idea holds some promise, given that NeRFs coarse-then-fine scheme, despite its effectiveness, is not thoroughly analyzed in the original paper.\n\nA drawback of the proposed technique is the need to finely sample the density field to create the approximation for inverse transform sampling. This seems to preclude major performance benefits that would otherwise be associated with importance sampling.\n\nThe experiments reported in Section 5.2 suggest that the proposed importance sampling scheme just doesn't work very well in its current implementation. The reconstruction quality is consistently lower than NeRF's, even if the coarse network of NeRF is disabled. (Could the authors clarify how many radiance evaluations the NeRF models in Table 1 and 2 perform?)\n\nThe comparison to DVGO also fails to show significant performance or quality improvements.\n",
