They have also planned the scope of the problem carefully, as can be evidenced from the notions like such as evolution form, evolution assumption, derivative-bound part, and derivative-free part, variational-ready PDE. \n\nWeakness:\n\nThe paper is one of bunch of definitions and some empirical analysis. It is not clear that the algorithm D-CIPHER can get past some of the major challenges with eliciting PDEs from data. Essentially, PDE estimation depends on the smooth function used to interpolate between observed data, and hence effectively depends on uncountable imputations between observations. Consequently, the estimated PDE (by any algorithm) tends to be heavily assumption dependent and extremely sensitive to noise. This issue has been deeply studied in the applied math literature and related machine learning literature, but the authors do not seem to be aware of this. The details in the supplementary materials also do not provide any theoretical results or hint that the algorithm indeed provides a consistent estimate of a PDE. I am surprised to find no discussion on or constraints and caveats based on signal to noise ratio, or chaotic systems and other well-known difficult/impossible cases of PDEs. \n\n",

It can discover PDE with nonlinear partial-free part and high-order ODE. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: (1) The designed method has the ability to discover the equation that cannot be represented as a linear combination of derivatives, and the empirical results are promising. (2) Using variational form as the objective in PDE discovery is novel.\n\nWeakness: (1) The relation between the challenges in PDE discovery and the proposed method is not clearly stated. For example, to discover the last four equations in Table 4, why original loss does not work? Is the proposed variational objective function necessary to discover this kind of PDE or just for optimization robustness?  Another example is that it claims the proposed method can find high order differential equations in a robust way. Which techniques can reflect robustness and what makes baseline method unstable? I cannot get why the proposed method has special benefit on learning high-order differential equations neither, because it still depends on the pre-given elements in the dictionary. I feel that there are many claimed points which makes me hard to catch which one is the main point that really works. (2) The presentation is poor. For example, the optimization procedure (CoLLie) is listed as a contribution in the introduction, however, there's no details about the algorithm in section 6. Therefore, I cannot justify whether the proposed procedure is new or not. The figures in experiments are not clearly introduced. For example, what is \"Abi. D-CIPHER\"? Why does some lines in Figure 2 disappear? ",

The approach is presented in a manner of framework where different modules can be chosen based on the problem at hand.
