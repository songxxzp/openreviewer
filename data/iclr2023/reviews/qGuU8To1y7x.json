But these metrics are just l2-loss in background regions and rain regions which are not excellent metrics since they don't measure the quality of background structures or quality of rain regions, and networks are prone to degrade background structures by over deraining.\n- Paper is well written with a detailed study of each experiment performed.\nWeaknesses:\n- section 4 Implications:\n     - Observations from the experiments are not excellent: \"Our strategy is simple: find a balance between background images and rain\nrange to avoid overfitting to rain streaks.\" This conclusion statement is naive since this statement is very obvious and doesn't require any experiments and study to get to this conclusion.\n    - It would have been better if authors propose a training strategy or a loss that addresses generalization problems in low-level visions\n    - Even though the experimental study is good, the conclusion and implications are not contributing to addressing the generalization problems of low-level vision.\n- Authors claim that networks have generalization problems in addressing deraining, but few existing works are proposed different generalization techniques in overcoming these generalizations differences between synthetic rain and real rain. Can authors perform similar experiments and study these semi-supervised deraining methods? Since it is important to know for the reader whether these semi-supervised deraining methods are overcoming these generalization problems in low-level vision\n- Experiments on real rainy images are not performed.\n- Can authors also discuss how their study can be generalized to other low-level vision tasks like de-hazing, desnowing, low-light enhancement?
