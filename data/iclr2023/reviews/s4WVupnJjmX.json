Based on transformer, human tokens and keypoint tokens are introduced and interacted to generate discriminate representations for human detection and keypoint estimation. The proposed aporoach achives state-of-the-art performance on COCO and CrowdPose datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the the components in the proposed approach. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The proposed approach introduces human tokens to interact with keypoint tokens to resolve the ambiguous association between keypoints and humans in the transformer framework.The approach is reasonable and novel. Explicit human detection contributes significant performance improvement in the proposed framework. The interaction between human and keypoint tokens further improves the performance. \n\n2. The representation of (x, y, w, h) instead of (x, y) for keypoints provides more contextual information for keypoint estimation as demonstrated in Table 5.\n\n3. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO and CrowdPose datasets with competing inference speed as shown in Tables 2 and 3. The proposed approach also has faster convergence speed than competing methods as shown in Figure 5.  \n\nWeaknesses:\nSome implementation details are missing: \n(1) The detailed losses are not presented in neither the paper nor the supplementary material. \n(2) Some details of the network structures are not provided (e.g. how many human detection decoders and human-to-keypoint detection decoders are used?)\n ",

The first part of this framework is a human detector based on deformable DETR and DAB-DETR, and outputs human-instance features and estimated human bounding boxes.  The second part, i.e. keypoint detector, is fed with a human-instance query and a set of keypoint queries which are initialized with its corresponding human-instance query. By doing so, the queries of keypoints belonging to one human instance can interact with each other while each keypoint query can also interact with its human-instance query. The keypoint locations are regressed by the keypoint detector. Experiments are performed on multiple datasets. the proposed method significantly outperforms one-stage SOTAs. When compared with two-stage methods, the proposed method performs better than bottom-up SOTAs, while performs comparably or worse than top-down SOTAs but with better efficiency and more succinct pipeline.  Besides, the ablation study also verifies the effectiveness of some proposed algorithm components.",

Many experiments have been conducted and the results seem satisfactory.\n\nWeakness:\n1. My main concern with this paper is the proposed explicit box detection process. Specifically, I think a clearer definition of what is the so-called explicit box detection process should be given more precisely. In the current version, it seems that I can only guess what it means, which brings me reading difficulties. From my guess, does this explicit box detection process just mean to explicitly detect bounding boxes for both the human and the keypoints? I personally use this understanding to understand this paper and I am sorry if I misunderstand it. \n2. Then with such an understanding, I think the advantage of such a process should be mentioned in more detail. Only demonstrating the advantage of such a process through experiments seems to be not enough to me. Besides, I am not sure if this process has improved the results because it really helps with pose estimation, or because it is more relevant to the task of object detection and therefore fits DETR and other existing object detection methods better. Can the authors also explain this?\n3. I also have some other minor worries w.r.t. the experiments. (1) I am not sure whether the authors overclaim their improvement a bit as it seems a large proportion of their improvement on Swin-L (1.5 -> 5.0 on crowdpose and 1.2 -> 2.7 on coco) is because they use an extra dataset Objects365. (2) I am not sure if it is allowed to put the result on COCO-test dev in the appendix only, as I am not sure whether this should be considered as a new dataset or not.",

The proposed human-to-keypoint decoder with the box-based keypoint formulation is the novel component. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable without resorting to post-processing, thanks to the DETR framework.

How are those bounding boxes determined for different keypoints of different persons in training to compute the keypoint box regression loss, L_k^l? Is the same method used in both the COCO and CrowdPose datasets? If not, how is the dataset prior (e.g., crowd vs not-so crowd) leveraged?  And, how sensitive is the proposed method to the keypoint boxes?\n\n- The interactive learning part is not clearly presented. How is the human-to-human interaction computed, as well as the human-keypoint and keypoint-keypoint? \n\n- Two references that seem to be relevant are not discussed.  1) N. Xue et al Learning Local-Global Contextual Adaptation for Multi-Person Pose Estimation, CVPR22; 2) D. Wang and S. Zhang, Contextual Instance Decoupling for Robust Multi-Person Pose Estimation, CVPR22. \n\n- It may be interesting to test the COCO or CrowdPose trained model on the OCHuman dataset to see the transferability as done in 1) N.
