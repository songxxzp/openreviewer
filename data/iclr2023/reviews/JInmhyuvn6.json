            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper discusses the data ownership problem from an economic perspective. The authors propose to use a compensation mechanism in the Modern Property Right Theory for solving data pricing problems in machine learning. Transferring the property right or ownership requires compensation, which is calculated by a modified least-core calculation. The formulation also incorporates fairness notions by introducing a parameter related to the contribution rate calculated through Shapley values. The paper also shows empirical experiments on data removal to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed mechanism.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. Provides data ownership from an economist\u2019s perspective. It is an insightful contribution to formulate data ownership and pricing problem in the property right theory.\n2. The time value introduction to contribution calculation is interesting.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The writing of the paper needs major improvement. Proofread to make the paper flow consistently. Also, providing brief explanations for concepts used as well as intuitive interpretations of the theoretical results could significantly improve the readability of the paper.\n2. Some details of the method are not clearly described, partially due to the flow of the paper.\n3. The experiments are lacking.\n\nI have provided more detailed explanations of the weaknesses below.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "1. How do you determine $W_i$ for each of the agents? Especially, in the experiments, if disrupting the orders of $W_i$ greatly changes the least-core\u2019s result, then the $W_i$\u2019s must be different for different agents. This essential part of the pricing mechanism is not clearly explained and specified in the paper.\n\n2. It is unclear why stability is naturally preferred over fairness in the allocations discussed at the beginning of Section 3.3. Suppose stability is what we care about, why is it necessary then to again incorporate fairness concepts in the final Core-cs formulation in Equation (10)? Is it right to say that it is easier to add elements of fairness into the core solution concept?\n\n3. I am confused about the rounds of investments described in Section 3.3. Can an agent make multiple rounds of investments? Also, I believe the compound interest should be related to the contribution rate of each agent. However, why is there a discrepancy between the notation $\\gamma_t^i$ and $\\gamma_i$. Please clarify this part and also the $\\gamma$ used in Equation (10).\n\n4. I need clarification about the problem setting. The paper\u2019s title restricts the method to data pricing problems where I suppose data samples are the resource that each agent invests in and collects. However, it does seem that the setting can be more general such as each agent can perform different functions in the process, such as data cleaning, pre-processing, or even training as briefly mentioned in the example in Section 4.2. My understanding is that as long as the utility can be clearly specified, the contribution rate and then the final compensation can be computed. Please clarify this point as it might mean wider applicability of the proposed method.\n\n5. There is confusion between the relaxation deficit parameter e in the relaxed core in (1) and the standard exponential number in the softmax function in (7). Also, is there any other stronger justification for using the softmax instead of the linear normalization? For example, how does it affect the experiments discussed in Section 5.2?\n\n6. The experiments are insufficient. 1) The figures do not strongly support the necessity of Core-cs, since the performance is not significantly different from Core in three of the four plots. 2) The effectiveness of the valuation is questionable on the breast cancer dataset (Figure 3), why does the accuracy increase after removing the first 10-20% of the highest valued data? 3) For the data pricing scheme to be practical, a much larger scale experiment with more complex datasets should be performed, e.g., on MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 or ImageNet.\n\n7. For the writing: There lacks an intuitive and clear description of the property right integration in the introduction and motivation section. I feel this is necessary to understand property right transfer as well the overall idea of the paper.\n\nMinor:\n\n8. Use of abbreviations. What is ICT on the first line? It was never spelled out anywhere else.\n9. Inconsistent capitalization. \u201cEven\u201d in the first paragraph. \u201cHigh\u201d in the second bullet point of Section 3.2. \u201cwhen\u201d in the last paragraph of Section 4.3.\n10. Inconsistent in-text citation. Some citations come with a space in front of the parenthesis but some don\u2019t. Please make it consistent.\n11. Typo. \u201cpropsed\u2019 in the second bullet point of Section 3.2. \u201ceffct\u201d in the second paragraph of Section 5.2.\n12. Careless. Missing punctuation before \u201cThis allows\u201d after Lemma 2 in Appendix A. Missing parenthesis in (12) in Appendix A.\n13. Figure captions. Are the captions for Figures 2 and 3 reversed? According to the experiment section, Figure 2 is for (Synthetic) dataset while Figure 3 is for the breast cancer (Natural) dataset.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper is a nice addition to the machine learning data pricing and ownership literature from an economist\u2019s perspective.

How to compensate each agent?\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Section 4.3: it\u2019s not clear how to determine $B_0^i$ in Eqn (8)\n- The efficiency aspect of the pricing mechanism in (9)-(10) needs to be further discussed. Specifically, to determine $\\gamma$, one needs to solve Shapley value, which has exponential complexity in the number of agents. The optimization in (9)-(10) per se is also combinatorial in the number of agents. \n- One of the most intriguing part of the proposed framework is the ability to deal with data chain (i.e., different agents take different roles in a data pipeline line: some are data pre-processor, some are model trainer). However, this part is not empirically validated in the experiment \n- Section 5.1 aims at validating Theorem 1. However, this theorem was not the contribution of this paper but proposed in Yan et al. It\u2019ll be great if the paper can focus on evaluating the differentiating factors of the paper.\n- The writing of the paper can be significantly improved. This manuscript contains a lot of typos and grammar issues. \n- If the paper\u2019s final target venue is ML conference, I would suggest the authors to significantly revise Section 3 \u201cPreliminaries and Background\u201d to contextualize the property right theory and other economic concepts in the machine learning and data analytics setup. \n",

The main contribution is the conceptual contribution of adopting the property rights theory in the problem of data valuation.

The main techniques come from previous literature. The method of deciding the contribution is basically the Data Shapley method from (Ghorbani & Zou, 2019), and the method of allocating compensations is just the least-core method from (Yan & Procaccia, 2021).\n2. The motivation for using property rights theory to assign integration power is not clear. How is this method fundamentally different from having a trusted central planner? It seems to me that the method is basically choosing a central planner among the agents based on their contributions. Furthermore, it is not clear how to prevent the integrator from malicious behaviors of giving non-truthful payments. ",
