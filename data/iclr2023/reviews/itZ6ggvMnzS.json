            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper describes iCITRIS, a generalization of CITRIS [Lippe et al 2022] to allow for \u201cinstantaneous effects\u201d: i.e. they allow dependencies between the latent variables within a given time step, as opposed to enforcing conditional independence of the latents at time t given the latents at time t-1. They start by showing that it is impossible to identify latents using only the CITRIS assumptions (known intervention targets & time series observations), because we can\u2019t distinguish between independent latents $P(z_1, z_2) = P(z_1)P(z_2)$ and entangled non-independent latents that have the same joint. However, if you have access to \u201cpartially perfect\u201d interventions that break the instantaneous dependencies, then you can recover the same identifiability results as those provided in CITRIS. They support their theory with a series of nice empirical demonstrations that show strong disentanglement on data generating processes with slightly weaker assumptions than their theory.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n - Instantaneous effects are an important problem to address if we are going to make causal representation learning practical, so I like the clear articulation of the setting and the problems that arise. The light / light switch example is a really nice simple illustrative example, but you could probably strengthen this motivation by finding more settings where this arrises: e.g. it is common in natural science applications where you can only measure a system infrequently (very common in biology); you want to argue that this is very common in practice (I think this is likely), and not just a feature of things that occur at the speed of light.\n - There\u2019s a really nice discussion of the assumptions in the appendix. Space is always an issue, but as much as possible of this should be moved into the text, because it does a better job than the main text of articulating what we\u2019re ruling out with the assumptions. \n\nWeaknesses:\n - The assumption that we know the intervention target is still very strong. This was true of CITRIS and is true here too. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s grounds for rejection, but I do think it severely limits what we can apply this method to.\n - Assumption 5\u2019s symmetry breaking condition seems tricky to verify. The appendix articulates a nice example of a failure case, and gives sufficient conditions for gaussian (interventions need to modify means) - do you have sufficient conditions for any other distributions? You say, \u201cthis assumption will likely hold in most practical scenarios\u201d - is that because most practical scenario involve Gaussians? Or some other reason?\n - The assumption that there is a bijection between X and both C and E is strong given the critique of methods that rely on counterfactual information (Locatello et al 2020, Brehmer et al 2022 and Ahjua et al 2022). It implies that the challenges of counterfactuals are reduced to \u201cjust\u201d solving disentanglement (of course this isn\u2019t an easy task), because we succeed in disentangling, there is no uncertainty about the noise variables in the abduction step, so counterfactuals are known exactly. I don\u2019t mind this assumption in this context \u2014 it\u2019s just saying that we see all the latents rendered visually \u2014 I\u2019m having had time deciding whether it really is weaker than the perturbation assumptions. \n - A lot of the detail about the actual implementation of the approach is hidden in a very long appendix - I know it\u2019s just maximum likelihood wrt to the appropriate interventional distributions, but we need a little more detail in the main text to know how that translates to a loss function (e.g. are the distriubiutions over latents conditionally gaussian? Something else? ) and how the various components of the method are parameterized.\n - I think a running example would really help. There are a lot of moving pieces, so if you could have an example to keep referencing, it\u2019d keep track of all the variables and relationships. E.g. C = [light state, switch state, \u2026], X = pixel level image of the light scene, G = \u2026 and so on. If you just look at how many variables show up in Definition 4.3, you can see that it\u2019s hard for a reader to track all the pieces. \n - Minimal causal variables were not well explained. I know this is a concept from Lippe et al 2022, but I would have liked to see an explanation here too, in order to make this paper self-contained.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": " - This is high quality original work.\n - I would have a really hard time reproducing this from the text alone. That may be because the method is just complex, but I think that the author could probably do a better job of illustrating the various piece that need to be implemented - a good figure would go a long way. They do supply code though.\n - I thought the Preliminaries (Appendix C1) section in the appendix was actually a really nice summary of the method - I found only really understood what you were doing once I read that. I know space is constrained, but augmenting figure 1 to include as much as possible of that information would be helpful to help keep track of all the moving pieces in this.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a causal representation learning method, iCITRIS, to solve the instantaneous effects of time series data via latent intervention. Specifically, iCITRIS learn a temporal process using VAE, where the latent variables can be identified by the construction. Then the structure learning methods such as NoTears and Enco are employed to learn the relations of latent variables.\nBeyond that, to solve the instantaneous effects, it assumes that the intervention targets are observed. Overall, as an extension of CITRIS, this method shows the ability to allow instantaneous effect in both theoretical and experimental perspectives.\n",

However, these interventions act on the latent variables.  How can we intervene the latent variables? Is it possible for the real-world application to observe the intervention targets?\n2) All experiments are conducted on the simulation environment, such as Temporal Causal3DIdent and Pinball. These datasets are far away from real-world videos where the latent variables are unseen and uncontrollable.  Could this method is used for real-world video benchmarks, such as traffic event (Sutd-trafficqa[1]) or human actions (Oops[2]) . These datasets are more important to evaluate causal representation learning.\n3) The contribution of this paper should be further highlighted. It is suggested to separate the original CITRIS method and this extension to avoid overlap and confusing contribution, e.g. adding a baseline method section to introduce CITRIS.\n\n[1]Xu L, Huang H, Liu J.
