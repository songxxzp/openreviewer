            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to tackle the problem of zero-shot semantic segmentation (ZS3). To capture the global feature relations and semantic information, SWIN transformer is adopted as the backbone. To improve the decision boundary, pixel-text auxiliary segmentation loss is used. Good benchmark results are obtained in Pascal VOC and Context datasets. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n1. The topic of zero-shot semantic segmentation is interesting and important. \n2. It achieves good benchmark results on Pascal VOC and Context datasets. (however the comparisons might be unfair, which will be described in Cons.)\n\n\nCons:\n1. The novelty of this paper is limited. It seems that the paper claims its novelty as using Swin Transformer, however, Swin Transformer has been widely used in CV community and simply adopts it as the backbone is not novel. In addition, the paper describes the cross-entropy loss, regression loss, semantic consistency loss in details. However, these techniques are proposed by JoEm (Baek et al. ICCV'2021). This paper simply uses them without any modifications. For L_aux, many papers have used similar losses. for example, Dong, Xiaoyi, et al. \"MaskCLIP: Masked Self-Distillation Advances Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.12262 (2022)..\n \n2. The comparisons of the experiments (Table. 2) might be unfair. It uses stronger backbone (Swin Transformer) network compared to other methods. Please add experiments of DeepLabV3+ for all K in Table. 2. \n\n3. Please also discuss the relationship with CLIP-based zero-shot segmentation methods in the related work section. \n\n4. The paper writing needs significant improvement and careful revision. (1) The use of symbols is inconsistent. Does s in Eq.4 and Eq.6 the same? Some times N is used for the number of seen categories, sometimes K is used. (2) The introduction of \"regression loss\" is mostly unclear. where does semantic feature maps (s) come from? (3) The use of citation is wrong throughout the whole paper. (4) There are many typos. for example, extra \"()\" in Table. 2; \"deeplabv3+\" and \"Deeplabv3+\" in Table. 1. \n\nQuestions:\nThe paper writing is not clear enough. \n1. In Table.1, Does the 1st row (deeplabv3+) mean JoEm? \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors propose a discriminative zero-shot semantic segmentation approach that uses transformer image and language encoders to exploit the global relations of visual features and to reduce seen class bias. In this approach, the image encoder is trained with calculating pixel-text score maps which use dense language-guided semantic prototypes. The authors argue that CNN-based ZS3 models sometimes fail to extract language-guided activation fields because they work in reduced receptive fields and use fewer attention mechanisms to extract global relations. Experimental results on benchmark Pascal VOC and Pascal Context datasets show that this approach (i.e. SwinZS3) obtains state-of-the-art results.",

The obtained limited experimental results (please see weaknesses) also support this situation.\n- Nice to see the impact of auxiliary segmentation loss on SwinZS3 and DeepLab methods.\nWeaknesses:\n- The text flow feels irregular. For example, CLIP-based meyhods are mentioned regardless of the context at the end of the Introduction section. Some figures are not referred from the text (eg, Fig.1 and Fig.4). Grammatical problems also disrupts the flow. In addition, the text contains too many typos; e.g. \"fro\", \"networkBaek\", \"generatining\", etc.\n- The authors follow the experimental settings provided by ZS3Net, and use 4 different splits for comparison with previous methods. However, there are 5 different splits according to the ZS3Net method and they share the results for 5 different splits in their paper. Hence, unseen-10 split results seem to be missing for both Pascal VOC and Pascal Context datasets.\n- When the results shared in Table 2 are examined, it is observed that the CSRL method generally obtains better results for the seen classes. However, there is no clear experimental result to support the central claim that the seen/unseen bias is alleviated via minimizing the euclidean distance and using the pixel-text score maps.\n\n*ZS3Net: Bucher, M., Vu, T.
