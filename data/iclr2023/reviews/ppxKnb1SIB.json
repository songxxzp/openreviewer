            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors explore explaining distribution shifts using interpretable transport mappings. The authors first propose a method which identifies $k$ features which maximally account for the optimal transport solution. They evaluate this method on the CivilComments dataset, finding that it outperforms a mean shift baseline. Then, the authors propose a method for explaining shifts by selecting $k$ clusters, which they evaluate on the Adult Income dataset. Finally, the authors demonstrate their ability to explain shifts in images by applying interpretable transport mappings to the latent space of a generative model to generate counterfactual images. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The paper tackles an important and practical problem in distribution shifts.\n- The authors test their method on a variety of datasets from different modalities, including images.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. There are several components of the method which are not explained very clearly in the paper:\n- It is unclear how the argmin problem in Equation 3 is actually solved. Is it always possible to decompose this function into a sum over individual features? What is the computational complexity of this problem?\n- I cannot find where the authors state the form of the $c$ function.\n- It is not clear what types of distribution shifts the proposed methods can identify. It seems that the OT method can identify arbitrary conditional shifts (i.e. $P(X_i | X_{\\neg i})$), whereas the mean method can only pick up marginal shifts ($P(X_i)$). The authors should clarify this, and perhaps contrast the difference with a new synthetic dataset in the appendix.\n- Is the output of the method dependent on the relative scale of the features? It seems that the authors normalize the Adult dataset, but do not state this fact explicitly.\n- The experiment in Section 6 is missing some details. For example, what is $\\Omega$ defined in $\\Omega_{high-dim}$ at the top of page 8? If it is a set of k-sparse mappings, then what is $k$ in Figure 3?\n\n2. The authors propose the PercentExplained metric, which is a measure of the effectiveness of the _mapping_. However, in practice, we only care about the effectiveness of the _explanation_. As an example, in the CivilComments result from Table 1, it seems that the output of the mean method (in terms of the features selected) is very similar to that of the OT method. For example, the top 4 features are identical for the F->M case. It seems that the reason why the OT method has much higher PercentExplained is because its underlying mapping is better. To compare the explanations of the two methods fairly, the authors should consider showing the PercentExplained for the mean method using the underlying mappings from OT.\n\n3. The output of the method for the Adult Income experiment in Figure 2 does not seem very meaningful to me. For example, the first cluster $C_M^1$ (presumably accounting for 80% of the shift), when mapped to the target (female) distribution, lowers the average age and the average education level, with a small increase in the average income. Does this indicate that middle-aged men have similar income to women who are slightly less educated and younger? It is not clear to me how this result would be actionable to a practitioner. \n\n4. The authors only compare against very simple baselines. For the Section 6 experiment, it seems that many I2I methods (which the authors reference) such as CycleGAN would be reasonable baselines. For the Section 5 experiment, I think Section 3 from Budhathoki et al., 2021 could work, using the attribution magnitude as a ranking.\n\n5. There are several spelling mistakes in the paper. For example, \"yeild\" at the top of page 4, a missing bracket in Equation 3, $P_y$ which should probably say $P_{tgt}$ at the end of Section 4.2, and a left over comment in Appendix D.\n\n6. Overall, the proposed methods do not seem very cohesive, and instead seems like a patchwork of approaches for different settings.",

It would be great to integrate this reasoning in the\nexperimental section too.\n\nA key point of achieving IT, however, is to rely on k-Sparse Transports.\nhow can we identify what k dimensions to transport points from P_src to\nP_tgt? Does this also need to be user-defined? Similar reasoning applies\nto k-Cluster Transport. It seems the approach requires domain knowledge\nand this is clearly applicable in specific contexts, where dimensions\nand clusters are still manageable, for instance, as the experiments show.\n\nThe evaluation is interesting although I am not sure the benefit of the\nauthors' approach stands out. Looking at the k-mean explanation only on\nthe specific evaluation shown in Table 1, it is possible to understand\nthe shift quite well without resorting to the authors' k-OT approach.\nThe authors provide an explanation in Section 5 but it still seems\nblurred.  Is it because of the higher percentage? That comes with a\nhigher computation induced by the authors' approach.
