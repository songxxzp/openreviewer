The authors also make a lot of reference to the cited paper by Kumar et al., frequently pointing out the differences in their approach (2022). The authors analyze the behavior of features after model pre-training and during the head probing (HP) phase, in which only the parameters of the head are updated, and the fine-tuning (FT) of the entire network. The analysis is carried out both with a toy example and also with more general downstream real tasks. By decomposing the learning dynamics of the representation\nextracted by the backbone, they find the keys are the energy and direction terms, which highly correlate with the accuracy at the beginning of the finetuning process, then they show how to manipulate the energy (e.g., stop the Head Probing stage earlier, label smoothing only in Head Probing, non-linear head, etc.) to enhance the downstream performance.",

Some example are:\n\u25cb \u201cAlthough we do not analyze the relationship between the change of zt and out-of-distribution performance \u2013 this adds too many \u201cmoving parts\u201d to the current setting \u2013 our analysis is also relevant to finding features which will work in new, unseen domains\u201d in Section 4. I think that out of distribution analysis is necessary to get a more thorough idea about the interaction between HP and FT, as stated in the highly mentioned Kumar et al., 2022\n\u25cb The paper lacks experiments regarding the relationship between backbone depth and head capacity. There are some examples in the appendix but they are too limited, considering that the use of non-linear and more complex heads (instead of the more basic linear probing) is one of the 3 practical suggestions given in the introduction\n\u25cf The experimental section lacks some information (that can often be found in the appendix, but that I consider essential for the fruition of the paper):\n\u25cb A description, even short, of the used architectures (and how they are decomposed in backbone and head)\n\u25cb A small description of the considered configurations, for example of the Byol and MoCo unsupervised cases\n\u25cb In table 1 it is not clear to me what HP\ud835\uded5*-FT means. If it means the configuration with the best \ud835\uded5, how \ud835\uded5 was chosen?\n\u25cf Some images (Figure 8 and 11) in the appendix are cited in the paper. Since these are quite useful perhaps it would be appropriate to include them somehow in the main paper\n\u25cf I think the difference between the dataset used for pre-training and the dataset used for fine-tuning is a key element of such an analysis.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the role of choice of task head, i.e. head tuning (HT), in the downstream performance of fine-tuning (FT) from a pre-trained model.\nRecent work has suggested that it is a good idea to first perform head tune on a downstream task and then use that head for fine-tuning (so that features do not move too much), rather than fine-tuning from a randomly initialized head (where features move a lot).\nThis paper also considers an intermediate case of stopping early during head tuning (to mildly adapt features) and finds empirically that in many cases the optimal stopping criterion is somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe paper delves deeper into the amount of feature adaptation w.r.t. number of steps $\\tau$ of HT performed initially, and find some interesting trends like norm of change in features $\\|z\\_t - z\\_0\\|$ is monotonically decreasing w.r.t. $\\tau$ while the norm of the features $\\|z\\_t\\|$ has a quadratic behavior. Theory on an overparametrized linear setting (NTK regime) that tries to explain these trends.\nThe analysis of 1 step of feature dynamics highlights an \u201cenergy\u201d term that strongly determines the amount of feature adaptation: energy is low when initial HT on top of pre-trained features already has good accuracy and vice versa.\n\n\nUsing these findings and analysis, the paper identifies label smoothing during HT as a way to control the \u201cenergy\u201d and allow feature adaptation. This often (but not always) performs comparably in practice to the optimal $\\tau$ (number of HT steps) which is not easy to find.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n\n- Overall the paper presents an interesting analysis of the role of task head in the fine-tuning performance. The following observations are interesting: the optimal stopping criterion is somewhere in the middle and that label-smoothing during head-tuning can help get closer to the performance of this optimal stopping criterion.\n\n- The paper also performs deeper analysis into some of these phenomena, e.g. analyzing the level of feature adaptation as a function of number of initial HT steps $\\tau$ or \"energy\". Many of the hypotheses are verified empirically even if not theoretically proved.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n- A lot of the analysis is hand wavy. For e.g. the effect of the task head on the FT features is studied by just looking at just 1 step of gradient descent. The notion of \"energy\" derived from this is also vague since it is technically a vector. Although empirically heuristics like the training accuracy or probability gap seem to be a good proxy for \"energy\". The theoretical result for the linear model uses $\\alpha$ in $\\alpha Y$ as a proxy for \"energy\". Despite all of these, the analysis seems somewhat meaningful.\n\n- I think the presentation of the paper can be significantly improved. I found the paper hard to follow and it took me at least 2 passes to understand how the different points in the paper connect to each other. There is a constant switching from number of HT steps being important to the \"energy\" being crucial to feature adaptation being the key. Rather than presenting the analysis first, I think it might help to start with the empirical observation that the ideal choice of task head is to initially HT for some $\\tau^*$ number of steps before FT. Then the goal of the entire study could be to understand this phenomenon and try to achieve this optimal performance in a simple way (e.g. label-smoothing is a solution). Without such a concrete goal, I was lost many times about the purpose of different sections.\n\nOther comments/questions:\n- If my interpretation is correct, it is a bit misleading to suggest in Proposition 1 (informal) that the result is about the effect of $\\tau$, because the X-axis seems to be something different, $\\alpha$ in $\\alpha Y$\n- \"This kind of z can make the original overlapped features become separable after adapting to a similar manifold\" on page 5. Could you please elaborate what this means?\n- How was the label-smoothing coefficient of 0.9 picked? How much of an effect does this have?\n- The discussion in Section 3.3 about head capacity seems to be hand-wavy and a distraction, since most of the results seem to use a linear head",

Their work builds upon the setup of Kumar et al, but they claim to relax the assumption made in that work that the pretrained model is optimal for the downstream task. \n\nThey decompose the training update to the features during finetuning and show theoretically that when the adaptation \u2018energy\u2019 increases (meaning that the predictions on the downstream task differ from the correct labels), the final representations (obtained after finetuning) change more. So, intuitively, controlling that energy is one way of controlling how much adaptation is performed on the features. One way to increase the energy is by doing less head probing before the fine-tuning phase (this way the head will be less suited to the downstream task at the start of the finetuning phase, so more adaptation occurs). Since the number of head probing epochs is difficult to tune, they propose label smoothing as an additional knob that can affect energy increase and also explore the effect of the capacity of the head. They show in several empirical scenarios results consistent with their intuitions and theoretical results. \n",

Are there cases where this addition can degrade performance? (I see at least one such entry in Table 1, for Flowers dataset, Sup-C10). The authors don\u2019t discuss the potential dangers of using it / weaknesses of this approach.\n\n- I\u2019m not sure what the practical take-aways are (see below)\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\n=====\n\nFig 1, the authors mention that one of the ways the setup differs between their work and Kumar et al is that \u2018information exchanges between the two parts of the network\u2019. I don\u2019t really understand this point. Doesn\u2019t this information exchange always happen during finetuning? What is special here?\n\nIn Section 2.3, for the different degrees to which we want to change the feature extractor, in \u2018strong\u2019, what is meant by \u2018the pretrained model overfits\u2019? Not clear if this refers to overfitting to the upstream task or the downstream task, and how exactly this is measured.\n\nFig 1 caption: define X_{PT} and X_{DS} \u2013 I assume it\u2019s \u2018pretraining\u2019 and \u2018downstream\u2019 respectively? But this should be stated.\n\nUnder Equation 1, in the equation z = Bx, I think this x should be X.\n\nIn Section 3.1, it\u2019s not clear to me what the superscript 0 in z_t^{(0)} and x^{(0)} means. Is this the first dimension of the embedding or the first example in the batch or something else?\n\nFigure 2: should explain the caption. I\u2019m assuming this HP x means that the head probing was run for x epochs? Should clarify.\n\nThe title of Section 3.2 is \u201cInitial value: two extreme cases\u201d. I did not understand what this is referring to. Initial value of what? And what are the two extreme cases? Are they \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018tiny\u2019? It\u2019s confusing as the results shown and discussed in this section (e.g. in Figures 2 and 3) show FT results for various phases of HT tuning which if I understand correctly are the \u2018intermediate\u2019 cases?\n\nFigure 4 caption says it\u2019s clear that mild adaptation makes the features more separable. More separable than what? Looks like strong adaptation makes them even more separable. Also, this figure should clarify what is the task in this case. I assume we don\u2019t always (i.e. for all tasks) expect greater separability with more adaptation. What does this depend on? Could we have the opposite phenomenon for other tasks?\n\nI don\u2019t understand Proposition 1. My understanding was that when the energy increases, the euclidean distance between original and final features also increases. But Proposition 1 states the opposite. Is this a mistake?\n\nFigure 5: the names of the columns are hard to understand. I also don\u2019t know what \u201c1-gap\u201d means. Why is the last column LP (linear probe?) instead of HP (head probe)? Not clear what exactly is the experimental setup here and what is the intended take-away.\n\nThe authors mention their analysis is also relevant for finding features that work well in a new, OOD domain. It would be useful to elaborate on this, as I feel if this is true it would add a lot of value to the paper. But I\u2019m not currently able to see how it\u2019s true.\n\nFigure 6: the caption says HP but the x-axis of subplots says LP. which is it?\n\nThe tasks used in all tables should be described. All notations used in figures should be described. There were several other instances aside from the above where I wondered what exactly a symbol means.\n\nQuality\n======\nIn practice, it is not easy to judge to what degree we want to update the pretrained model for a new downstream task (\u2018strong\u2019, \u2018mild\u2019 or \u2018tiny\u2019). This is due to often not having enough data or resources downstream to assess aspects like \u2018the model overfits\u2019, and in addition it is difficult to estimate task relatedness (e.g. how related or different is the downstream task to the upstream one) - this in and of itself is an open problem. So it\u2019s not easy to tell whether the pretrained model is \u2018reasonably good\u2019 (for mild for instance) on the downstream task. Given this, it is not clear to me what is the recommendation given by the authors for how to modify the way in which we finetune models, since the recommendation seems to be conditional on somehow making this difficult choice.\n\nWhile the paper proposes a set of practical tricks to alleviate this, like label smoothing, I\u2019m not necessarily convinced that it always helps and never hurts (for all downstream tasks). For example, I see at least one entry in Table 1 where it can hurt performance, for the Flowers dataset, with Sup-C10. It feels like more analysis on the effect of label smoothing needs to be done before this recommendation can be safely made.\n\nIn Figure 3, it seems that the \u2018end\u2019 histogram always matches the e_y pretty well, regardless of the head used (random or after HT). This doesn\u2019t really make a strong case for having to be careful about how we do HT / FT. Are there other cases where we can see bigger differences? Perhaps transferring to a downstream task that is \u201cvery different\u201d from the upstream one?\n\nWhile the analysis here is interesting, it\u2019s not clear to me how exactly it relates to the ultimate goal: analyzing the effect of design choices of HP/FT on the actual downstream *performance*. As the authors also pointed out, analyzing the change on the features is an indirection and it\u2019s less clear why it\u2019s relevant / how to inform practical decision making.\n\nSection 3.3 \u201cbackbone depth and head capacity\u201d makes some intuitive observations which however aren\u2019t too surprising, and also aren\u2019t very actionable. Again, how can we assess whether low-level features (of the pretrained model) will be beneficial for a new downstream task while high-level features harmful? \n\nNovelty\n======\nThe proposed particular analysis is novel to the best of my knowledge. \n\nReproducibility\n============\nThe procedure proposed is simple enough that I feel confident I could implement it. But I encourage the authors to provide all details about hyperparameters, task details etc, to aid in reproducibility, and make their code available.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper analyzes the effect of different head designs on the adaptation that occurs in the learned features after the finetuning phase. Their analysis is novel to the best of my knowledge and some findings are interesting. However, I found that the writing and presentation can be improved (see clarity section above) and I\u2019m also unsure about the usefulness of practical takeaways from the paper (see above detailed comments). For this reason, I\u2019m doubtful if the size of the contribution meets the bar for acceptance.\n\n\n===============================\n\nAfter rebuttal: The new version of the paper is clearer and better structured. I particularly liked the User Guide section. I also like the discussion around difficulty in making these design choices in practice, the risks associated with some decisions (e.g. label smoothing, etc) and the inclusion of recommendations for making them based on increasingly-risky interventions. Based on this, I increased my score from a 5 to a 6.",
