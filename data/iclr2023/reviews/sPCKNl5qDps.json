The related formulas and definitions of ORC in graphs are extended to hypergraphs, making their concepts consistent with geometric intuitions and rigorous proofs.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Figure 1 needs to be more clear and intuitive. For example, too many directed edges are used in Figure 1(d) to describe the random walk of weighted edges. It is recommended to use the relationship between the weighted edge and the hyperedge cardinality to represent, so that would be more concise.\n2. The definition of AGG(s) in Eq. (14) is ambiguous. In this paper, it is said that Eq.(14) is consistent with the previously defined hyperedge curvature. But should we understand it as the sum of AGG for nodes in subset s or  understand it as AGGM(s) ?\n3. In Corollary6, only Equal-Nodes Random Walk is analyzed, but Equal-Edges Random Walk and Weighted-Edges Random Walk are not analyzed.\n4. In Figure 3a, the shapes and colors in the legend indicate errors, languages should be represented by upper triangles, and Nerds should be represented by dots.\n5. This paper uses unlabeled datasets for experiments and then uses the Wasserstein Clustering Coefficient to measure the results. We recommend using a labeled dataset, so that ground truth can be accurately obtained, allowing for more intuitive comparison of results.\n6. This paper generalizes the Ollivier-Ricci curvature of graphs to hypergraphs, and the experimental part should focus on the advantages of using hypergraph curvature and compare ORCHID with methods which using Ollivier-Ricci curvature for graphs.",

In that case, curvature is (basically) the curvature describes the contraction of the map from points x to the transition probabilities from x. \n\nThere is a \"canonical\" choice of Markov chain for graphs -- (lazy) random walk -- but there's no obvious choice for hypergraphs, so the paper explores three possibilities. It also proves some bounds and intuitive properties of these definitions. \n\nOne motivation for introducing a new notion of curvature is to have a \"local\" (and thus simple to compute) parameter that is indicative of \"global\" features of the network. This idea is tested in an exploratory empirical study, where the newly introduced curvatures seem to function as meaninful features for clustering and hypergraph exploration/node differentiation. ",

For instance, I do not understand to what the authors are comparing Table 13 to. \n- More broadly, since are other notions of curvature for hypergraphs, and other methods for extracting hypergraph features, I would like to understand how the new notion introduced here compares to the alternatives in practice.

To my mind, the most compelling empirical results are the ones in Figure 3 and Table 2, which allow for quick comparisons of different features. \n\nI think a few other directions could be discussed with respect to the exploratory analysis. For instance, what is the geometric meaning of curvature in examples (eg. are highly cited articles extremal for curvature because the literature \"diverges\" in many different directions away from them?). \n\n*Reproducibility*\n\nI did not check this carefully but it seems possible to reproduce everything with the material given.",
