            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies provable sim-to-real transfer in the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. The paper proposes a robust learning algorithm for the simulation part and derives provable guarantees without assuming access to real world data. In order to obtain the guarantees, the authors propose a novel history clipping technique that improves the bound significantly.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- The paper is theoretically sound and the proofs appear to be correct.\n- The paper is well-motivated by a practical need to extend sim-to-real analysis to continuous and partially observable regimes.\n\nWeakness\n- Section 4 took many reads to fully appreciate. Particularly, while section 4.1 is reasonable and the reduction technique is standard, as the authors argued, it was not immediately clear why Algorithm 1 (LQG-VTR) is necessary for proving the properties of $\\pi_{RT}$ defined in Definition 1. Since the section is the \"meat\" of the paper, so to speak, providing more intuition and insights into the analytical techniques could make the work easier to digest.\n- Some of the parts of the paper are not self contained. For instance, in Appendix C, multiple references to the algorithms and results in Lale et al (2021) are made without providing sufficient discussion on why the results in Lale et al (2021) are useful or intuition on what purposes these references serve, which makes it harder to properly assess the soundness of the paper. A further revision could greatly ameliorate this weakness.\n\n--------- Post Rebuttal Update --------------\n\nThank the authors for their commitment to making the paper easier to digest. I would like to keep my score as is.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity. See the previous section on weaknesses.\n\n- Novelty. The LQG setting is novel and, as the authors argue, able to capture the challenges in practical applications of Sim-to-real transfer. The proof techniques, especially the history clipping technique, are significantly different from existing works and sufficiently novel.\n\n- Quality. The proofs appear to be correct and the statements seem sound.\n\n- Reproducibility. See previous section on weaknesses. While I am confident that domain experts would have little issue reproducing the proofs, currently the way the work is presented makes it more difficult to reproduce them.",

The paper contributes to this less explored area. \n\n2. The upper and lower bounds on the sim-to-real gap are novel, to my knowledge. \n\n3. A detailed algorithm is provided to conduct sim-to-real transfer. \n\nSome suggestions:\n\n1. Sim-to-real transfer is important in many real-world applications. This problem is application driven. However, I am not sure if the upper and lower error bounds of the sim-to-real gap would offer practitioners any useful insight when conducting transfer learning. The author(s) might want to heavily revised the article to better discuss the insights you obtained that are useful to practical situations. \n\n2. According to my understand, the paper borrows some techniques in minimax learning theory and seems to be an application of these techniques to sim-to-real transfer. The author(s) might want to discuss whether such an application is challenging and if the established results are sufficiently novel beyond the existing literature. \n\n3. $\\pi_{RT}$ is defined in a population level. It would be better if more details can be provided on how to obtain this oracle policy. In addition, the definition does not involve the sample size used for training. The theoretical results in Theorems 1 & 2 seem to be asymptotic. It also did not involve many other practically important parameters (e.g., the size of training data).\n\n4. Algorithm 1 shall be highlighted in the paper instead of putting it in Section 4. The paper would benefit from a detailed discussion on the advances of the this algorithm beyond the existing literature. \n\n5. The LQG model assumption is not very realistic in real applications. In the introduction, the author(s) mentioned that the partial observability was motivated by the OpenAI environments. However, do these environments satisfy the LQG model assumption?\n\n ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the behavior of the sim-to-real gap for partially observed linear-Gaussian systems with quadratic cost. The authors formalize the sim-to-real gap as the finite-horizon minimax regret of a policy across a set of plausible simulators. The main argument is that the finite-horizon minimax regret can be bounded by a horizon-adjusted infinite-horizon regret up to an additive constant, hence it suffices to show that the infinite-horizon regret  minimization problem can be solved with bounded regret. The authors show this using an optimistic policy. There are, however, some number of technicalities to be taken care of along the way.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* To the best of my understanding this is a sensible argument and there seems to be non-trivial novelty in this derivation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper is very dense and hard to unpack. Perhaps some of the technical details can be relegated to the appendix, giving more space for the main conceptual flow. Especially, for example, if the technical restrictions of the systems class are standard fare, they don't need to consume space in the main text given that they're not involved in any of the novel arguments. \n* There are some writing nits, such as the fact that Gaussian is not capitalized in \"linear quadratic gaussian\" but is capitalized in \"Gaussian distribution\". As a proper name, Gaussian needs to be capitalized in every situation. There are also some tautologies, e.g.  \"We follow\nChen et al. (2021) to present a formal formulation\" (as opposed to an informal formulation). Generally, the writing would benefit from some clean-up.\n* The preliminaries section seems to be very close to that of Lale's work. There are a number of common sentences. I do not believe this was done in bad faith, but the authors should consider rewriting this to avoid possible accusations of (auto)plagiarism.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is quite dense to read the main idea comes quite late after a lot of preliminaries (of which many are not being actively used in the main text).
