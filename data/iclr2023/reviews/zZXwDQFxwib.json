            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work aims to analyze the use of two exploration novelty bonuses - global bonuses and episodic bonuses - in the problem of exploration in environments. Previous works show that global novelty is computed using agent\u2019s entire training experience while episodic novelty is constrained within the specific episode the agent is in. This paper delves into the different behaviors of these two bonuses. When there is little shared structure between environments, episodic bonuses are useful; when there is more structure shared between environments, global bonuses are useful. This leads to the combination of global and episodic bonuses, and evaluation on various settings. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths \n- This work is based on the contextual MDP (CMDP) setting, where C is the context space in addition to the MDP setting. Per each episode, the context c is sampled from the context distribution. \n- Nice and detailed explanations on background on exploration bonuses (RND, novelD, AGAC, RIDE) in section 2.2. \n- I think the main part of this paper is the section 3, raising the questions of when are episodic bonuses and global novelty bonuses are useful, respectively. \n- There are some example of CMDPs where global novelty bonuses fail, and advantage of the episodic bonuses succeed.(MiniHack, for example). Where the environment changes each episode, global bonuses fail (Figure 2). \n- There are other cases of CMDPs where global novelty bonuses are preferred. This is useful (1) singleton MDP case (2) although with large |C|, the structures are shared across contexts. \n- I think the arguments made by the authors are compelling so far. \n- The experiments in the section 3 are valid\n- Evaluations are valid. \n\nWeakness\n- Although the authors showed the insights on when to prefer global bonuses, and when to prefer episodic bonuses, and its relationship with level of structures being shared across the context. I think the contribution is not largely significant. This paper does not introduce a new algorithm,  although it shows some design choices for episodic and global novelty bonuses. \n- Although the authors argue that general CMDPs with large |C| with shared structures across contexts are good fit for global bonuses, they didn\u2019t add theoretical insights in it; only tried to prove it via one example.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The authors try to tackle an interesting problem in a clear to understand way. The evaluation is reasonable diverse, but could be improvement by adding different domains (not just variants of MiniHack). However, the paper suffers from flaws in the reasoning, combined with a lack of a crucial detail (the used feature space, see next section). The claims from Sections 3.1 do only hold under the used state feature spaces, because it does not generalize due to the context dependent value of the feature space. It is likely, that a context independent feature space - like the message features from Section 3.2 - will not be affected by the mentioned issue. This is also supported by Figure 5b, showing competitive results for the episodic variant. Furthermore, the results from Sec. 3.3 and 4 are not clearly showing the assumed benefit, as explained in the next Section.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is well written and the authors introduce a reasoning for each of their steps, that is clear to follow. The notation cloud use some slight improvements by clearly stating which methods (Sec. 2.2) are working on a featurized representation of the state ($\\psi(s)$), but this is not required to fully understand the paper. The result section is missing some details, that the read can only try to infer. Namely, the state feature space used for the experiments in Sec. 3.3 and 4. Furthermore, Figure 6 lacks a frame of reference - meaning results without a combination of bonus terms. The reviewer assumes that the experiments shown in Figure 6 are based on the same feature space as Fig 4 & 5. Under that assumption, it seems like the global-only variant is outperforming the combined method in Corridors and KeyRoom, putting the claims into question. Something comparable is true for Section 4: Assuming that the message feature space was also used where applicable, some improvements are expected by combining E3B with a global method, because the global method should be capable of generalizing across contexts (compare Fig 5b). A comparison with a pure global method is required for substantiating the claims. It is still interesting that only the multiplicative method is able to show these improvements, but this cannot overcome the mentioned issues.\n\nThe analysis itself is novel, but the proposed method (multiplicative bonus) is a straight forward combination of existing ideas. However, additional insight into exploration strategies is a relevant topic in this domain, as this is important for reducing sample requirements and improving applicability. Reproducibility is assumed, given the source code should be available and architectural details as well as hyperparameters are given.  ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is well written, but lacks a crucial detail and contains some questionable argumentations. Namely, the effect of the feature space is not sufficiently evaluated and it is not clear if a global-only bonus would be sufficient, given a context independent state feature space. In conclusion, the quality of the proposed method is not substantiated. The authors should clarify the mentioned feature space issues and add additional experiments with a global-only baseline and evaluate different feature spaces, if possible.",

It proposes a simple way of combining global and episodic bonuses that work nicely in the tasks that they investigate. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: this study provided nice toy tasks that gave good intuition about when global vs episodic exploration bonuses would be beneficial and when they would not. Their multiplicative combination solution at the end of the paper (combining the 2) was a simple solution that can be easily implemented. They hypothesized why it works (the relative scaling of gobal vs episodic bonuses over  episodes). Finally, the fact that they tried it both for count-based bonuses as well as the more scalable E3B bonus was commendable. \n\nWeaknesses: The tasks tried remain toyish and are limited in scope (confined to the minihack suite). While I really liked the demonstrations they provided, and think that minihack is a good start, it would have been nice to see at least a hint of either 1) how global vs episodic exploration bonuses behave in a slightly more scaled up task (e.g. procgen or anything with nontrivial pixels), or 2) how their multiplicative solution behaves in such a scaled up task and whether it still works. \n\nFinally, their investigation of their multiplicative solution ends on a hypothesis: that it works because of the relative scaling of global vs episodic bonuses over  episodes. It would have been great if they could provide some more comprehensive empirical evidence for this hypothesis. The question of how to combine global & episodic exploration bonuses is a good question (and more generally, understanding  the effects of exploration durign learning/generalization is a very important question in RL). The authors did a cool experiment investigating multiplicative vs additive combination.  It is a very simple manipulation, but simple manipulations often have great merit. They should have dissected this experiment  for a more comprehensive understanding of this result. ",
