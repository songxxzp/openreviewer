            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes to use pretrained protein representations for predicting whether two given proteins interact (protein-protein interaction, PPI). Specifically, it proposes to use pretrained embeddings from the encoder part of the OmegaFold protein structure prediction model. For the trained prediction network, a GNN operating on PPI networks is proposed, where the OmegaFold embeddings are the node features and the task is to predict whether an edge between two proteins in the network exists. As known PPI networks by definition only contain true edges, negative sampling is applied during training and evaluation to augment the network with negative edges.\n\n\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "+ Multiple datasets considered\n- Poor baseline choices\n- Unclear model design - advantage of both structural embeddings and GNN aggregation is not supported by results\n\n\nQuestions:\nHow does the model compare to an AlphaFold-Multimer based PPI prediction approach?\nHow does the model compare to a baseline that just uses OmegaFold embeddings pairwise without any GNN?\nHow do OmegaFold embeddings compare to just directly using OmegaPLM embeddings? This is a relevant comparison as the paper tries to prove that using structural embeddings is advantageous.\n\nThe paper exhaustively discusses OmegaFold, which is distracting given that this is previous work and is just used as a pretrained model without any modifications.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The idea of using OmegaFold embeddings is new. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "While the basic idea of using protein structural embeddings for PPI is well motivated, the paper does a poor job at proving that the proposed model indeed works. First of all, the baseline for comparison is arbitrarily weak and certainly not the previous state of the art. PPI prediction is a hard task, and a simple ResNet trained directly on protein sequences cannot be expected to perform particularly well. It is therefore impossible to tell from the presented results how the model compares to other PPI approaches. It is especially worrying that any comparison to AlphaFold-Multimer is missing, both in the results and in the discussion. A starting point could be Bryant 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28865-w)\n\nThe second issue is the GNN layer of the model. The paper presents itself as a method to predict pairwise interactions between proteins. However, instead of taking in two proteins at a time as input, the model considers a network of proteins, each represented by its structural embedding. The network is then optimized to predict whether the edges between proteins in the network are true or false, which requires random negative sampling during training. First of all, it is not clear how exactly this negative sampling was done. Additionally, it is unclear why the GNN layer and the network are needed at all, when the task is to predict the interaction between two proteins only. If the problem is cast in this way, it is necessary to show that this improves performance over a model just operating on pairwise inputs.",

Two datasets of PPI networks (antibody-target interaction and membrane protein interaction) are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n1. The motivation is well founded, since unlike link prediction in social networks, similar proteins may not interact and interacting proteins may not be similar. Thus, explicit usage of structural embeddings should be critical in accurate protein-protein interaction prediction.\n2. Additional experiments are conducted to verify the transferability of PPI prediction models across different species.\n\nCons:\n1. Limited contribution and novelty. The pre-trained structural embedding is directly adopted from OmegaFold, and it seems that the main contribution in the methodology aspect is using graph neural networks with structural embeddings as inputs for PPI prediction.\n2. Since initial structural embeddings may have different length, authors adopt mean pooling along the sequence dimension to obtain fixed-length representation of each protein. Such protein-level embedding may fail to capture local structures actually participating the interaction with other proteins.\n3. The results of \u201cPSE4PPI-SAGE\u201d and \u201cPSE4PPI-GAT\u201d on ATI and H-PPI datasets are not consistent in Table 2 and 3. Please clarify.\n\nSome minor issues:\n1. Table 1. Why the number of unique nodes in the ATI dataset is only 2?\n2. Table 2, 3, and 4. It would be better to use bold numbers to highlight the best results in each column.\n3. Based on my understanding, by default, OmegaFold does not take an actual MSA as inputs. Instead, it generates a pseudo MSA by randomly masking a certain ratio of amino-acid residues in the original sequence multiple times. Please clarify which type of MSA is used in the proposed method.\n4. Additional proofreading may be needed to correct typos and grammatical mistakes in the current manuscript.",
