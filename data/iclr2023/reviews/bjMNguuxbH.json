            "summary_of_the_paper": "Cognitive neuroscience aims to reveal the underlying brain regions corresponding to different cognitive processes, and such studies are usually performed by comparing and contrasting the fMRI scans of subjects performing designed cognitive tasks. A major drawback in this field is the high cost of data acquisition, which limits the sample size and hence undermines the statistical power. Meta-analysis over many individual studies, though may partially overcome the sample size issue, usually runs into data unavailability issues where only the locations (in form of standardized coordinates) of peaks of activations are reported in literature while the raw image data are not publicly shared.\n\nOn the other hand of the story are the recent efforts (e.g., NeuroVault, OpenNeuro) of aggregating and curating data from individual studies yielding large-scale public image repositories. In these repositories, however, the annotations and metadata are usually scarce and inconsistent.\n\nThe authors claimed that the rich text data from neuroscientific literature and the large-scale public image data are complementary. Leveraging the advantages from both sides, they proposed a novel meta-analysis method that can decode fMRI statistical maps corresponding to concepts in neuroscientific literature.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n1. The authors proposed an interesting workflow. If I understand it correctly, the authors are using the following priors: (1) fMRI brain maps is tightly correlated to the underlying cognitive states, and (2) distribution of peak locations in fMRI brain maps is highly correlated to the overall global pattern in fMRI brain maps. With these priors, the authors proposed to train a neural network model to predict the global fMRI pattern from sparse locations of peaks, and with that trained model they synthesized a paired dataset of (cognitive descriptions, global fMRI patterns) using the (cognitive descriptions, sparse locations of peaks) from the neuroscientific literatures. Finally, they trained a separate decoder with the (cognitive descriptions, global fMRI patterns) pairs to decode the former from the latter. The decoder is the ultimate piece of mastery that can describe the underlying cognitive states of an arbitrary fMRI image.\n\nWeaknesses\n1. In my humble opinion, the abstract may need to be better articulated. I was very disoriented and confused by the abstract until I finished reading the introduction section. Specifically, I was confused by (1) what the two complementary sources of data are, (2) why they are complementary, and (3) what is the proposed method trying to accomplish. For (1) and (2), even though the two sources of data are both explicitly mentioned, I did not have enough context to parse their relationship. In contrary, the introduction section has a very natural flow and is painless to follow.\n2. It is a bit misleading that when the authors mentioned the word \u201cimage\u201d they did not necessarily mean \u201cimage\u201d, but rather the \u201c1x1024 vector representation in the DeFuMo space of the image\u201d. I believe it might be helpful to provide a clarifying statement somewhere early in the paper to avoid potential misunderstanding.\n3. Figure 1 can be further polished. (1) Figure 1A did not clearly show what data format is provided and what are derived. It might be better if that information is illustrated more explicitly. (2) A lot of things are represented as \u201cblue thin rectangle\u201d, yet some of them are modules/operations while others are entities. It may be better to replace some of them. For example, \u201cReconstruction\u201d and \u201cdecoder\u201d can be replaced by sketches of the neural networks, and \u201cLabels\u201d can be replaced by some clipart object, etc. (3) The caption mentioned that in Figure 1B, the brain map is reconstructed using the trained model, so it would be better to show the sketch of model in an appropriate place and indicate that its weights are frozen.\n4. The reconstruction performance (Section 5.1, Figure 2) is quite poor. a correlation of 0.3 does not seem too promising.\n\nMinor Things\n1. Is there some typo in the following sentence? Page 5, 3rd paragraph. \u201cWhen the percentile corresponds to a To avoid selecting studies with a null tf-idf value, we replace the percentile threshold with a strictly positive tf-idf value criteria.\u201d",

            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper contains several controversial claims. \n\nThe paper uses Nilearn to estimate peaks and then uses these peaks to learn a model from data. However, there is no evaluation of the error associated with the selection of these peaks. Further, what evidence shows that you are more likely to see neural responses in these peaks than examining the whole brain data?\n\nAnother concern is the proposed formulation. As an example, what is the definition of the function f() in Equation 1? To learn f*, what constraints are considered? The same question can be asked for D in Equation 2. Due to the fact that D without any constraint may increase the chance of overfitting. \n\nEmpirical studies are another concern. The proposed method only compares with some classic machine learning approaches, such as Kernel Ridge or Space Gaussian. There are several groups of state-of-the-art techniques that aim at similar types of analysis and should be compared with the proposed approach, e.g., HTFA (Manning 2018), BRSA (Cai 2016), and DRD (Wu 2019). \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned concerns, the proposed approach should clarify some related concepts for multi-subject and multi-resource analysis. It seems that this study uses multi-subject data. However, I could not find anywhere that discusses how the author(s) functionally align brain responses from different subjects. Alternatively, Neuro Vault is a multi-resource repository where data are provided from different machines and environments. I also did not find any information on how the proposed method deals with bach effects to learn a model from multi-site data. You may provide additional information in a preprocessing/preparation section.\n",

The definition of tasks and problems are very clear.\n2.For a decoding task, the idea that fully utilize the rich descriptions of the studied cognitive tasks in scientific report is novel.\nWeaknesses\n1.My major concern is the necessity of image reconstruction from peaks. As illustrated in the paper, the authors train a reconstruction network to convert the peak coordinates into images. In my opinion, this ill-posed problem is too hard to be reasonable. Reconstructing the fMRI from only a few peak coordinates (less than 100 according to the paper) seems impossible to recover the details of images. Thus, the reconstruction is unnecessary. If the peak coordinates contain enough information for the following decoding tasks, reconstruction would introduce inevitable noise. If the peak coordinates are not enough, reconstruction still can\u2019t help the decoding since extra information comes from the \u2018guessing\u2019 of the trained network. Can the authors give more explanation about this?\n2.Also, the experiments do not verify that image reconstruction can help in improving the decoding performance. The ablation study should compare with model using peak coordinates as input.
