            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper provides a new structure identifiability result for temporal causal discovery, specifically time-series structural equation model with nonlinear lagged and instantaneous effects. The key advancement is that the identifiability result allows for history-dependent noise, while existing works typically assume independent noise. The paper further proposes a structure identification method based on continuous optimization, variational inference, and deep learning. Empirical results for synthetic and real world data are further reported.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- The identifiability result and identification method both seem to be sound.\n- Theoretical and empirical results are provided.\n- The motivation of using history-dependent noise is convincing as far as I know.\n\nWeaknesses/Main Points\n- Several proof techniques are adapted from prior works. It would be clearer to explicitly acknowledge/summarize in the main paper (Section 4.1) if any of the important proof technique are adapted from prior works, instead of only mentioning in the Appendix.\n- Some of the writing may be confusing. Is Rhino a type of structural equation model (SEM), or a structural identification method? In Section 3.1 and Theorem 1, it seems that Rhino is defined as a certain type of structural equation model Eq. (5). However, in Section 3.2 and many other parts, it seems that Rhino is a structure identification method that refers to Eq. (10). I think it would be clearer to make a distinction between SEM/identifiability and identification. E.g., we often use LINGAM to refer to the specific structural equation model, and ICA-LINGAM/Direct-LINGAM to refer to the specific method.\n- Section 3.2 mentions that augmented Lagrangian training is used to make sure Rhino only produces DAGs. Does Theorem 2 require the augmented Lagrangian training or the DAG assumption of Rhino's solution?\n    - If yes:\n        - The authors should make this clear in the theorem statement. The current statement seems like any value of $\\rho$ and $\\alpha$ suffices, and the solution (or search space) need not be DAG.\n        - Is there any theoretical guarantee that Rhino only produces DAGs with such training? What assumptions are needed? Such assumptions should also be clearly stated in the theorem statement. \n    - If no:\n        - Why do we still need such DAG penalty and augmented Lagrangian training?\n- What values of $\\lambda$ in Eq. (10) is needed for Theorem 2 to hold? For infinite data, do we still need sparseness prior? (In many statistics/ML settings, sparseness is often used for finite samples.)\n- Theorem 2: What does it specifically mean to be no model misspeficiation? Could the authors provide a precise technical definition?\n- The paper should make it very clear that Theorem 2 is based on global solution of Eq. (10). In practice, it is impossible and we often end up with a local solution.",
