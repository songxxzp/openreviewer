In a GAN-based framework, a mapping from facial templates to the intermediate latent space of a pre-trained face generation network is learned, from which high-resolution reconstructed face images can be generated. The proposed method can be\napplied in whitebox and blackbox attacks against face recognition systems. \n",

Within a GAN-based framework, the mapping from facial templates to the latent space of a pre-trained face generation network is learned.\n-\tThe method is proposed for whitebox and blackbox attack scenarios. The method is based on the whitebox knowledge of the face recognition model, and it then extended to an attack blackbox scenario, using another face recognition model that the adversary has access to.\n\nThere are some aspects in the paper that need clarification:\n-\tIn my opinion the novelty of the paper is limited. The proposed method mainly relies on StyleGAN3 for face reconstruction. \n-\tDue to the social security and ethical implications of this works, authors could have described possible solutions to mitigate the effect of the proposed attacks.  \n-\tAuthors did not discuss the results in a good way. It is not clear which are the limitations of the method, and which are the case some reconstructions are not well recognized. No examples are given of such cases. \n",
