This is rather disappointing given that the OT baseline uses no information for the graph summarization step.\n* Regarding the lack of clarity\n    * In general, the paper lacks both structure and discussions about the potential impacts of the findings. The paper should be largely rewritten to improve on understandability.\n        * Regarding Structure, as an example, Section 5 is interesting but it misses an important point which is to discuss whether the proposed method (Section 4.2) suffers from the limitations presented in Theorem 2 or not\n            * This is discussed in the experimental section (6.2) but it would be nice to provide insights on this question in Section 5\n        * Regarding discussions, here are a few examples:\n            * In Section 4.3, the assumption \"that the random node attributes are independent\" seems rather strong and not sufficiently motivated. Also, I do not understand the formulation in Equation (13): could the authors detail their derivation for $P(G_V | X_V, C)$ and the underlying assumptions if there are any?\n            * In Section 5, the counter-example should be better discussed so as to convey the important message about why this specific example is a counter example, rather than focusing on calculations. Maybe starting with the Theorem + proof and then using the example could avoid redundancy in the text and help focus the counter-example on its illustrative power\n            \n\n* Minor issues\n    * Strange that authors do not cite anything related to Gromov-Wasserstein for graphs in their literature about the use of Optimal Transport on graphs\n    * Section 2 is a copy-paste of the beginning of Section 3!\n    * Theorem 2: $X_G$ => $X_V$?\n    * I do not understand what the authors mean by \"we tag best out of XX% of nodes as sensitive using ...\"",

The authors extend an optimum transport-based framework method for graph summarization (Garg & Jaakkola (2019)) to a supervised graph summarization method which also preserves information for the class label by maximising their mutual information. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated on several datasets such as MNIST outperforming the baseline that is based on optimum transport.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- This work is well-motivated in terms of how employing supervised graph summarization might help enhance the model in downstream tasks. \n\n- I like how this work presents the limitations of existing work on OT and then attempts to address them with a new method.\n\n- Showing that supervised graph summarization is NP-hard is good information because it encourages researchers to think of fast ways to estimate the solution, which the authors attempted to do.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The colors in Table 1 are confusing as colors are usually used to identify which results are state-of-the-art and second place. Also, I found it difficult to associate each result with its corresponding method. I would find it a lot easier to read if there was a column \"model\" that shows the model for each row of results.\n- It is not clear what is meant by OT since most methods are Optimal Transport based. It would be easier to parse the results if a citation is provided next to the method's name such as OT. Is this one by Garg & Jaakkola (2019)?\n- Results on larger-scale datasets like ImageNet are missing. Having large scale datasets as part of the benchmark is important since this method's main strength is to compress large graphs while maintaining information that helps in the downstream task. \n- It would be useful to know concrete numbers on how many gigabytes of size would be reduced with compression and speed-up in seconds to identify the practical aspect of this work.\n- The 100% accuracy on MNIST is a bit suspicious because as far as I know there are few images there that are ambiguous to humans even. Can you elaborate more on how the proposed method got 100% accuracy?\n- The results in many cases do not seem significant between the baseline and the proposed method, except on MNIST, can you clarify why that is happening? Also, it seems strange that the compressed graph allows the classifier to train better than the uncompressed version, how did that happen?\n\nOverall this work brings interesting insights and methodology to the table, and I am curious about clarifications on the points I mentioned in the Weaknesses.
