            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new algorithm, referred to as the LAVA method, for evaluating the minimal weight arborescence of a directed graph which each of the edges carries a weight. It was shown in the literature that this question can be reduced to the Multi-Pair Shortest Path (MPSP) problem. The present paper investigates this problem through deep learning methods: it introduces a new algorithm based on neural networks, states a result about its time-complexity, and shows numerical results and comparisons with existing methods of the literature.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The main strength of this paper is that it is rather complete: it introduces a new algorithm for a difficult problem and analyses it both theoretically and numerically. However, it suffers from two important flaws:\n- First, the announced complexity in O(log n) contractions for the MPSP problem puts the proposed algorithm at the same level as the Lovasz algorithm developed in 1985. (The authors also announce that their algorithm benefits from \"friendly and efficient\" CPU and GPU implementation, but they should be more precise on this point. In particular, they should precisely compare their contribution and Lovasz algorithm on this aspect.)\n- Second, the experimental analysis is mainly dedicated to the comparison with the Chu-Liu Edmonds method, introduced in 1965, which is theoretically worse because it needs O(n) contractions.\nFor these two reasons, the contribution is poorly situated with respect to the state of the art, both theoretically and numerically. The authors mention themselves more recent references than the two mentioned above, which should serve as baselines.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "From my point of view, the paper is not very well organized, with notably a number of redundancies in the positioning in the literature.\n\nThe part dedicated to learning is insufficiently clear and detailed. For example, I did not understand the idea of learning the weight function $\\phi$ of the graph since it is supposed to be known. The structure of the network and the way it is trained should be investigated in depth. The generation of the training data seems to me to be a difficult problem which, unless I am mistaken, is not addressed at all in the article.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The proposed algorithm certainly deserves attention, but, in my opinion, both the presentation and the theoretical and numerical results do not allow the publication of this article in its current form.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This research considers structured learning problems on arborescence from input graphs. Prior algorithms are CLE, Lovasz algorithms, and their variants. The authors find the general MPSP problem(sub-problem of the original problem) can be simplified when working with machine learning models. This is because the learning model predicts edge weights for all pairs of vertices and the graph is always complete. Through this observation, they can restrict the scope of the original problem and thus decrease the computation burden. Some other tricks are also mentioned for large-scale learning tasks. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. They cleverly use the observation that edge weights for all pairs of vertices and the graph always complete in learning model, they modify the prior algorithms by restricting the scope, which can decrease the computation burden.\n2. Consider the algorithm in GPU setting, they change the traditional operation to GPU-friendly operation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. I am not sure that the contribution part \"Theoretically, we show that our Lava method takes O(log n) and CLE takes O(log n) round of contractions.\" whether the CLE takes O(log n) is typo.\n2. In numeric experiment, the  proposed algorithms seems not better than Lovasz algorithms, in some cases even worse than CLE. They claim that their algorithm is suitable for large-scale, but they actually do not test large-scale real dataset.\n3. The idea of the paper needed to be explained more clearly.",

I found it difficult to even extract a clear problem statement/setup (and only then did it make sense as I have seen similar setups before).  Without major revisions, I cannot see voting to accept this work.\n\nQuality:  It seems like neural networks are just randomly inserted here.  To be more specific, while the proposed improvements apply to weights determined by a neural network, I don't understand why neural networks are necessary here.  The primary result could be stated more generically, at least as far as I can tell, and the application of this result is then in dependency parsing, etc. where neural networks are used.  \n\nNovelty:  While building heavily on existing methods, the suggested improvements do seem to be novel -- though it isn't clear to me that this special case is not addressed elsewhere in other, more theoretical, works.  \n\nReproducibility:  I found the description of everything sufficiently unclear.  I'm not confident that I could reproduce the experimental results.",
