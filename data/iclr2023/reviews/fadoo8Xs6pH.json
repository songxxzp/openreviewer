            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work studies a quantitative separation between two fundamental models of\nanti-symmetric functions in quantum chemistry: The Slater ansatz and Jastrow\nansatz. The authors construct a target function (Equation 20) using a subtle\nproperty of Schur polynomials to show that the Jastrow ansatz can approximate\nthis function with exponentially fewer variables than the Slater ansatz. This\ngives the first explicit separation between the two ansatze. Finally, the\nauthors begin to illustrate this separation property empirically by fitting a\nmodified version of this target function with neural network-based relaxations\nof the two ansatze.",

There are connections to\n  representation learning (i.e., representing the target function via neural\n  network-based ansatze), but they seem limited in scope.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- [page 2] suggestion: It might be slightly more direct to first give the\n  mathematical definition of *Slater determinant*, and then describe what is\n  happening in words. The determinant-based definition is very direct and easy\n  to parse.\n- [page 7] Given the nature of this paper, the experiments used to explore\n  Theorem 3.1 are very under-developed. The main results are interesting and\n  exciting, but this does not fully come through from the experiments.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies quantitative separations between two families of antisymmetric functions: The Slater Ansatz which is a linear combination of Slater determinants and the more powerful Jastrow Ansatz where each Slater determinant is augmented by a symmetric prefactor (and hence remains antisymmetric). In this area of research, it is widely known that Jastrow ansatz is more efficient (in terms of expressivity) compared to Slater, yet no separation was known. The paper provides such a separation in terms of expressivity power.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The main result of this paper is a \u201chard\u201d antisymmetric function that has the following properties:\n\n(a) the function cannot be approximated better than some constant with $o(\\exp(N^2))$ many Slater determinants, where $N$ is the number of particles (i.e., dimension of the space). This means that its Slater ansatz is quite inefficient.\n\n(b) the function can be written in the Jastrow ansatz using a single Slater determinant and a prefactor which is parametrized by neural networks of width, depth and weights of order either $O(N^N)$ with ReLU activations or $\\mathrm{poly}(N)$ with other activations.\n\nThe paper is well-written and its contribution is clear. The hard instance's construction seems nice and relies on some known tools from representation theory. Essentially, the provided separation adds to other results related to architecture separations in terms of approximation power. Regarding technical novelty, the only contribution lies in the construction of the hard instance. However, it is not clear to me whether the construction and the technical novelty can place the paper higher than marginally above the acceptance threshold. It would be nice if the authors could further motivate the studied problem. \n\nIn short, I believe that the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold, yet I am willing to increase my score depending on authors' response. \n\nI would like to close with some questions:\n\nQ1. Could the authors provide some ML applications of these antisymmetric ansatze? Do they only arise in quantum chemistry applications?\n\nQ2. Could the authors further comment on the last open question they propose?",
