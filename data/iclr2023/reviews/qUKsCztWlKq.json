The ablation study show that the FKIoU loss achieves better results than the smooth L1 loss on three detection tasks (aerial, scene text, and face).\nThe results on the 3D detection seem also promising.\n \nWeaknesses: \n \nSome results do not seem fair compared to SOTA.\nTable 1 shows that GWD and KLD reach better results than the smooth L1 loss on the DOTA datasets. However, in the ablation study of table 2, where the approach is evaluated on the other 2D datasets, the proposed loss is only compared with the smooth L1 loss. Why not comparing with GWD and KLD ?\nIn Table 5, when comparing the 2-stage approaches, the backbone used is different from all the other works, preventing the fair comparison. One can ask if the improvement is due to the loss, or to the backbone.\n\nBe careful with the proofreading, some errors complicate the reading (e.g. logical connectors in the beginning of the abstract).\n\nThe limitation mentioned in the appendix should be highlighted in a dedicated section, before the conclusion, for example.\n",

It remains unclear how this is a drawback. What is the concrete effort to tune these hyperparameters ? Does it exist default values for them, and what is the impact on the final performance (best-tuned vs default) ? In brief, are these hyperparameters a real issue ?\n\nStraight arrows from Figure 1 are hard to understand.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Training deep models to correctly detect and outline rotated objects is difficult due to the nature of the metric of reference (SkewIoU). The authors propose KFIoU, an easily computable and differentiable loss that relies on transforming bounding boxes into Gaussians and estimating the overlap between the Gaussians analytically. Experiments demonstrate both that the derived proxy loss follows SkewIoU trends fairly well, and leads to strong performance on both 2D and 3D benchmarks.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- KFIoU is an easy to compute and differentiate loss with well principled motivation.\n- KFIoU is hyper-parameter free and fairly simple to implement.\n- The paper is mostly well-written with clear illustrations (notably Fig. 2) that sum up the problem and solution.\n- Experimental results seem to validate the efficiency of the method with regards to previous approaches on both 2D and 3D detection tasks.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- No indication of uncertainty or context is given on the results. What is the standard deviation? How many runs were performed for each result? Are the baseline results reported or reproduced? If reported, are the settings comparable?\n- The center loss is simply added as a correction term. This seems to work well, but it does not really reflect the product of Gaussian at the center of the paper. Have the authors tried using the distance between centers as a multiplicative factor on the KFIoU?\n- This is more of an issue of semantics, but I am unconvinced by the paper\u2019s positioning around Kalman filtering. At its core, KFIoU computes the overlap between two Gaussians through a product of the pdfs which is well known to also be a Gaussian pdf up to a scale factor. While this procedure is indeed very important in Kalman filtering to reconcile observations and predictions, it is just a small part of the entire process. As such, I feel like the paper\u2019s reliance on Kalman filtering detracts from its actual key points.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is well written for the most parts. There are a few typos (e.g. equation (6)\u2019s second term is incorrect as is, and is probably unnecessary as well), and some structural changes might benefit the paper (e.g. wait until eq. (7) to discuss bounding box volume, write out explicitly the full loss in a dedicated equation).\nAs discussed in the weaknesses, I think the paper overall suffers from leaning so heavily on Kalman filtering. Even without making use of Kalman filtering, I feel like the contribution of the paper is significant enough.\nMiscellaneous comments:\n- Why not show the EMean in Table 1?\n- Is the upper bound on the value of KFIoU really important? An estimation of the difference between SkewIoU and KFIoU \u2013 if attainable \u2013 would be much more valuable.\n",

Compared to other Gaussian modeling based losses like the GWD and KLD losses, this loss is hyperparameter free, and is the first one used in a 3D environment.

Its main advantage is a seemingly closer approximation of the SkewIoU dynamics, while being hyperparameter free.\n\nWeaknesses: The method presented is really similar to the KLD loss, and present only very marginal improvements on DOTA (when using its center loss), and present no comparison with KLD for the other datasets of Table 2 and 3. \nThe choice of using Kalman Filter (over the previous Gaussian modeling based losses) to create this new loss is never truly motivated. It is not justified why this method should result in a more physically reasonable loss, or one that is theoretically closer to the true SkewIoU value (other than using a similar formula than IoU). The experiments justifying the \"alignment\" between the losses are not really convincing either (see below).",

Neither a theoretical nor an experimental reason is ever clearly given on why the KFIoU loss should be clearly chosen over KLD or GWD loss.\n\nAs such, there is only limited novelty in this work compared to previous Gaussian based losses. The comparison of the KFIoU loss to the 3D object detection case is indeed novel; however without comparison to the KLD or GWD losses, this contribution is difficult to judge.\n\nThe constant pointing of SkewIoU as being \"gradient-training unfriendly\" is never truly explained or motivated. Even in the case that SkewIoU is particularly difficult to implement/backpropagate with, the main losses KFIoU is being compared with are losses such as KLD and GWD, and not SkewIoU.\n\nThe use of a scatter plot for Fig 3 c is questionable for its clarity. Fig 3 a-b do not seem to showcase a particular improvement of the KFIoU loss over the GWD and KLD losses. It is also unclear why no values of EMean are presented compared to EVar in Table 1. As such, it is difficult to truly conclude on comparisons between GWD KLD and KFIoU losses.\n\nThere are many spelling and grammar mistakes in the articles.
