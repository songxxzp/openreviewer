            "summary_of_the_paper": "This article presents a novel system that brings differentiable physics and neural radiance fields for dynamic scenes by augmenting a NeRF with a differentiable continuum dynamics model. A hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation is defined in this system to permit advecting geometry and appearance. This framework outperforms previous approaches validated by a wide variety of systems.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n(1) It is interesting to combine NeRF with physical constraints.\n(2) This paper is well written.\n(3) In most cases, the results are encouraging.\n\nSummary of Weakness:   \n(1) Euler method and advection equation are both very fundamental and usually applied in highly restricted mathematical or physical models, which are not defined directly so that the theoretical level of this work satisfies a more general case.   \n(2) There are some limitations as mentioned before, which are not listed in the article clearly.    \n(3) Part of the experimental results is difficult to understand, disobeying universal physics phenomenon.   \n(4)The authors haven\u2019t listed the source of their ground truth data.\n\nMain Questions:   \nThough part of the results shown in this article reflects stable properties of the framework, the authors may not be familiar with the fluid dynamics field. Here are some following questions:   \n1) This article is aimed to estimate both the unknown geometry and physical parameters of highly dynamic objects from multi-view videos. It is noticed that a droplet is regarded as Newtonian fluid, but this property would be destroyed when velocity exceeds a boundary value. Additionally, in the general case, the descent of a droplet drop to the ground may not satisfy the two assumptions.\n2) As for fluid dynamics fields, what is the source of the listed ground truth data (In house codes, CFD software, or open-source codes)? It cannot be made sure whether this ground truth data is convincing or not.   \n3) It is conspicuous that the method presented in this article requires the properties defined as continuum and conservation. Hence, listing the limitations clearly is necessary.\n\nThings to improve the paper that did not impact the score:   \n(1) Clarify the limitations of the framework;   \n(2) If simulations of physics models are unavoidable, fundamental knowledge of other fields is necessary to present meaningful outcomes. For example, fluid dynamics is necessary for the authors to get familiar with.  \n(3) Illustrating what kinds of physics models could be solved by the Euler scheme and governed by the advection scheme with low accuracy loss and time steps cost.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a method to recover a scene's geometry and physical parameters from a collection of images. It combines a neural radiance field method with a differentiable physics engine to jointly recover a deforming object's geometry, color, and physical parameters using continuum mechanics modeling. \n\nThe NERF model is dynamic to adapt the geometry over time and is based on the direct voxel grid optimization proposed by Sun et al. (2022) that greatly speeds up training a NERF. The differentiable physics engine is based on the MPM included in DIFFTAICHI. \n\nThe paper describes the required steps to convert from the NERF representation of the geometry to particles that move with physical constraints. The NERF and physical parameters are recovered by optimizing a photometric cost function where the physical constraints are implicitly included in the dynamic part of the NERF.    \n\nThe experiments use synthetically generated scenes with various continuum materials, including Newtonian fluids, non-Newtonian fluids, granular media, deformable solids, and plasticine.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\n- The combination of NERF and differentiable continuum mechanics to identify a system's physical parameters and geometry is new. \n- The method is well constructed, and each step is properly justified. The change from Eulerian to Lagrangian is a very clever way to combine the physical constraints and the NERF model. \n- The results are impressive, even though it only uses synthetically generated scenes. The method is even outperforming the oracle baseline, where the geometry is known. \n\nWeaknesses\n- The paper does not include results with real data, which leaves some questions unanswered. (see my comments in the next section)\n- The dataset includes only gravity as an external force and a ground plane whose position is known. Other more complex scenarios are not dealt with in the paper. \n- The camera poses must be accurate and vary significantly to obtain good results with a NERF method. In practice, this introduces some constraints on the scene, such as a rigid background with a sufficient amount of texture to run structure-from-motion. These constraints are a bit ignored in the paper.  ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\n\nThe paper is well-written, but it's not always easy to follow, and some details are only superficially discussed, although that is understandable in a conference publication. Some details about the implementation are somehow hidden or difficult to find :\n\n- Is the method able to automatically distinguish between Newtonian fluids, non-Newtonian fluids, granular media, deformable solids, and plasticine? Does each material class need to be fixed beforehand since it employs different constitutive equations (strain-stress)? The system would need a material property classifier in a more general application.  \n- The material parameters seem to be uniform. What could be the adaptation for non-uniform materials? Does the MPM support more complex materials?\n- Why is the Oracle baseline so poor in comparison with other methods? Is there any logical explanation for it?.\n\nQuality\n\nThe paper is of high quality in general and solves a very difficult problem. The results are well-presented and motivated. The state-of-the-art is well-evaluated, and the experimental evaluation is convincing.\n\nNovelty\n\nThis paper combines two existing methods (NERF and a Differentiable Physics Engine) to solve a very complex problem. These methods work with very different representations. The paper proposes a well-grounded strategy to combine them and shows that it works well in photorealistic scenes with large deformations.  It makes the paper novelty more than sufficient. \n\nReproducibility\n\nSome of the details regarding the MPM method are hidden. It would be very beneficial for the community to publish the code or a more detailed report about the work. \n\n\n",
