They then propose using Bayesian Neural Networks is appropriate for these challenges and propose choices for the BNN setup suitable for ransomware attack detection. \n\nAn overview of their method is as follows:\n1. They first convert each incident's low-level events to high-dimensional MITRE ATT&CK features. \n2. To tackle signal sparsity, they make use of a commonly known mixture of priors with Spike and Slab components widely used in Bayesian Variable Selection.\n3. To employ (2) in BNNs, they use a spike and slab prior to the weights. They prove a simple form for the KL divergence of two random variables with Spike and Slab distributions, later used in optimizing the BNN.\n4. They reason Radial distribution is a better choice for the slab component.\n5. To enable backpropagation through the sampling mechanism used in computing the loss, they use the parametrization trick for the slab radial component and substitute the Bernoulli part with Gumble-Softmax.\n\nThen they compare their method with other approaches on one dataset. They also perform ablation studies and report runtime stats. They finally show how the BNN model can be used to give feature importance scores.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is well written, and although there is a lot of math the content is communicated well.\n\nThe proven theorem is interesting and simplifies calculating KL of weight priors to the approximate posterior distribution.\n\nThe relevant work is very properly cited making it easy to understand the paper.\n\nThe ROC curves show their method outperforms alternatives for ransomware attack detection. Their plot has confidence ranges that gives a better picture of their method's performance.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper's clarity is good, and the points are well articulated.\n\nIn terms of quality, the math is sound. However, more explanation is required for why slab and spike priors are appropriate for sparse signals since it's the main part of the approach. (instead of just citing the papers). The number of methods compared to each other is admirable.\n\nHowever, the fact that there are just results on one dataset is a major negative point. I strongly recommend the authors find a dataset with a similar characteristic suitable for the proposed approach and run the comparisons again.\n\nIn terms of novelty, I acknowledge that the appropriate usage of spike and slab and the radial distribution choices are interesting. Also the theorem simplifies calculating the weight prior KLs. However, I'm not sure how these are important since the results are just reported on a single dataset. Such a method in my mind requires validation of every choice made throughout multiple datasets else it can look like a stack of clever heuristics. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this work, the authors propose to detect ransomware-based attacks amongst a general class of malware attacks using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). In such settings, the feature set available to subsequently perform inference or detection of vulnerabilities is quite sparse, and imbalanced. In order to address this, the paper proposes to utilize a new architecture for the BNN, namely using a Radial Spike and Slab BNN. Here, the weights are assumed to arise from a mixture distribution, with the first component being a dirac mass (or \u201cspike\u201d) and the second having an atomless support (or \u201cslab\u201d), namely a Radial distribution (Farquhar et al., 2020).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1) The setting of malware detection through the use of variational inference with BNNs is indeed an important topic of study, with possible immediate implications towards real-world security.\n2) The proposed Radial Spike and Slab distribution for the BNN is indeed interesting, and helps simultaneously model a mixture distribution of discrete and atomless components to address the specific issues that are commonly seen to arise from the feature sets available in the setting of malware detection. The use of the Radial distribution (proposed by Farquhar et al., 2020) for the atomless component also helps circumvent the concentration of measure within an annulus as seen for multivariate gaussians in large dimensional settings.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n1) The scope of the paper as presented is quite limited to the particular application of BNNs for detecting ransomware attacks amongst a set of more general malware attacks. This is quite disparate from that required in practical scenarios, wherein real-world security systems need to raise alerts amongst feature sets corresponding to (rare) occurrences of abnormal activity, amongst the general set of normal functioning parameters.\n2) Furthermore, it is unclear why ransomware attacks alone are studied, given that other rare modes of malware attacks exist with corresponding sparse feature sets and comparable severity in ramifications arising from the security breach, all of which could potentially be addressed using BNNs as well. Thus, it is unclear why the detection of ransomware attacks alone amongst a set of malware attacks with equivalent or greater severity is required.\n3)  The empirical evaluations presented are fairly limited, and could be significantly improved. For example, the paper states that variants of XGBoost produced random results. However, given that it is known that out of the sparse binary feature set of dimension 706, the 298 MITRE ATT&CK features are known to form the most crucial subset. Thus, for several models of lower complexity, this reduced feature set could be used to attain significantly improved baselines, by utilizing this domain-expert specific information to exclude near-irrelevant features.\n4) Furthermore, the improvement in detection performance achieved using the proposed method as compared to baseline approaches such as BNN-Radial are extremely marginal, if any, as observed from Table-1. It is unclear if any improvement in detection performance can be established in a statistically significant manner, without performance statistics reported over multiple training instances of these networks with different random seeds. \n\n\nMinor Typos:\nThe  abstract needs to be modified to follow the ICLR 2023 guidelines for typesetting and formatting.\nThe citation scheme used in the paper results in several instances where author names appear contiguously within sentences without demarcation. \n",
