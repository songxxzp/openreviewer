            "summary_of_the_paper": "The contribution of the paper is twofold: The paper explores if the \u201cstandard training protocol\u201d in multi agent communication exhibits features observed in natural language, namely, if agents are able to communicate with new partners within the same population, and if lager populations tend to develop more structured languages. Authors show that, it is not the case. Moreover, they show that objective function of the standard training approach for multi agents is the same as that of a single pair of agents due to receivers co-adapting to their training partners. Second, authors propose an alternative training approach which partitions sender-receiver pairs which limits co-adaptation of receiver agents. They show that this alternative approach maximizes an objective function that involves two parts:\none function to maximize the \u201cinternal communication\u201d between pair of agents and another function to maximize the \u201cmutual intelligibility\u201d across agents. They empirically show that this partitioning approach increases the effect of population size on compositionality and allows emergence of a more structured language, thus allowing to exhibit those features in natural language.\n\n\n",

The authors analyze the standard population-based training protocol and point out that the overall objective is the same as that of a single-pair training protocol. The co-adaptation of receivers to senders in the standard method is believed to limit the effect of population. To better make use of population, the paper proposes to partition agents into pairs and one receiver is only trained with its associated sender. The authors claim that such partitioning enhances zero-shot communication with new partners as well as the compositionality of the emergent language. Empirical results in two referential games verify the statements and the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

I appreciate the intuition of reducing co-adaptation to enhance the compositionality of the emergent language. \n- The main results and the ablation study clearly show the effectiveness of the method and the influence of all the components and factors.\n\nWeakness:\n- Two communication graphs are adopted in the experiments, as shown in figure 2. However, the fully-connected graph and the circular graph are the two extreme cases. Maybe it is necessary to add a randomly sampled graph as a reference.\n- The experiments are all conducted on the referential games, where the receiver only needs to pick a candidate from a set as the prediction of the original object. What if we extend the game into a sequential decision problem? For example, the sender may send messages as the instructions, and the receiver needs to achieve some goals (such as navigation to the goals) by following such instructions. I wonder whether the proposed method can be applied to these games.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of using population-based training to learn more \"natural\" languages for communicating between agents.  When two agents (a \"sender\" and a \"receiver\") are trained to solve a communication task together, the communication protocol, or language, that they learn often lacks structure, and simply maps arbitrary strings of symbols to different objects.  Surprisingly, training populations agents, and randomly pairing senders and receivers, does not lead to the agents converging to a more significantly structured language than training a single pair of agents.  This paper argues that this is due to the fact that no matter how large the population, the population-level training objective can be maximized by a single receiver policy that simply memorizes the (arbitrary) languages of each sender.\n\nTo address this issue, this work modifies the population-based training procedure so that while senders are rewarded for being able to communicate with multiple receivers, each receiver is only required to understand communication from a single sender.  This prevents receivers from directly optimizing their behavior with respect to the average behavior of the senders, while requiring that the senders be interpretable by many distinct receivers.  The experimental results demonstrate that the under this \"partitioned\" training paradigm, receiver agents are able to correctly interpret communication from senders that they were never paired with during training (which is not observed without partitioning).  Perhaps more importantly, the languages learned by the senders demonstrate significantly more structure (as measured by the topological similarity between the language and the underlying object space), than those learned without this partitioning mechanism.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The main contribution of this work is that it provides a convincing explanation for the somewhat counterintuitive phenomenon that population-based training does not more structured and less arbitrary synthetic languages in cooperative communication tasks.  They also present a straightforward solution to this issue through a simple modification of the training process, and demonstrate that this recovers the behavior that was originally expected from population-based training.  There are potential applications of these ideas to other topics such as zero-shot coordination in RL or human-AI interaction more generally.\n\nThe main weakness of the work is that the value of learning more \"structured\" languages in this setting is not fully articulated.  Practical use cases for this training setup, even if only hypothetical, would be helpful in understanding how we should evaluate emergent languages relative to one another.  One example might be to use an emergent language to evaluate to train an agent designed to adapt to existing languages (eg. a particular human language) in an online fashion.  Another might be to design visual communication protocols for user interfaces that are structure in a way that makes it easy for humans to interpret them.  The lack of such motivation means that we cannot determine how useful metrics such as topological similarity really are as proxies for performance in realistic applications.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Overall the work is technically correct, and well presented.  They indicate that source code for their experiments will be available upon publication.  While the work builds heavily on existing methods and results, it presents novel and useful insights about the problem.\n\nA few suggestions for potential improvements:\n- the training objectives form general-sum game between the senders and receivers, and so some discussion of whether behaviors reliably converge, or whether cyclic behavior was observed, would be useful.\n- Examples of the languages actually learned by the agents would help the reader understand the practical significance of the topological similarity measure.\n- a more detailed analysis of whether there is a trade-off between the topological similarity and the accuracy of the learned languages in the ImageNet task would be helpful in understanding whether the partitioned approach to training might be detrimental in some cases.\n- A minor point, but using pi to denote both a sender's strategy, and the posterior over objects induced by that strategy is somewhat confusing when reading Section 3, so perhaps a different notation should be considered.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall the work provides useful, and somewhat surprising, insights that have not been previously published.  It also demonstrates that a simple modification to population-based training can substantially change the nature of the solutions learned in cooperative communication tasks, which raises the question of whether similar changes might be useful for population based training in other multi-agent settings.",
