            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies a multiagent POMDP and proposes a communication mechanism for the agents to exchange information about their decision-making. In the process, the agents have the same objective, aiming to find a joint policy that maximizes their utility. The authors introduced a communication mechanism for the agents, which consists of a negotiation phase and a lauching pahse. In the negotiation phase, the agents communicate their observations, and in the lauching pahse, they communicate their decision-making. The latter is further implemented according to a hierarchical structure, where the agent at each level k send information to the agent at level k+1. The paper prents both theoretical results about the convergence of the agents' strategies to an equilibrium and empirical results about the performance of the proposed approach.",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Introducing sequential decision making may prove both a valuable and feasible approach to some MARL tasks.\n\nHowever, the domain on which the proposed algorithm would successfully operate seems largely exaggerated. The underlying game-theoretic construct of MARL tasks should most definitely considered as a given, and not as a control knob. Whether a game will play out sequentially or simultaneously is -- at least within the approach and scope of building a novel MARL algorithm -- the innate characteristic of the game and not a choice for the algorithm designer. SeqComm may function correctly in MARL tasks that naturally and inherently involve sequentiality, but such a demonstration is missing. This lack significantly undermines the applicability of the algorithm.\n\nEven if there is some justification as to the applicability of SeqComm on arbitrary MARL tasks, the performance gain comes at a huge cost of communicating n-1 rounds. Actual performance may deteriorate from this best case (n-1 rounds), as \"some agents are required to communicate intention values with others multiple times until the priority of decision-making is finally determined.\" Furthermore, each of those rounds involves Monte Carlo sampling. This means that every single tick in the x-axis (steps) actually involves, at best n-1 \"sub-steps\", each of which carries out Monte Carlo sampling. Since every figure in the paper is plotted against the number of training steps, not a single figure pictures a fair comparison between SeqComm and the baselines.\n\nMoreover, the paper needs a much better foundation in terms of its connection to game theory. Simultaneous games are prone to non-stationarity precisely because the players' information sets are limited. Making a distinction between the decision-making phase and the action execution phase does not change the fact SeqComm alters information sets. There is no discussion whatsoever in this regard (e.g., information sets, bounded rationality, non-stationarity), and SeqComm proceeds straight to interfere with the players' information sets, which are dictated by the nature of the game and not by the algorithm's working mechanism.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\nIt is unclear how SeqComm would be applicable to arbitrary MARL tasks. Even if applicable, the performance gain must be normalized against the additional computation.\n\nQuality\nPlots against training steps are misleading. \"Miscoordination\" on page 6 is not defined, so its avoidance cannot be measured. The latency tolerance disclaimer on page 6 is unsupported. Improvements on SeqComm runtime on real-world communication technology (e.g., 5G) cannot be measured/claimed unless accompanied by training (wall clock) times in seconds.\n\nOriginality\nTo the best of my knowledge, SeqComm is a novel algorithm.",

The paper introduces multi-agent sequential decision and demonstrates that ordering in this paradigm can affect the optimality of the learnt policy. \n\nThe authors then present SeqComm. Each agent in SeqComm learns a policy which conditions on the joint hidden state and other agents' actions via an attention mechanism. The ordering is chosen by weighing the value of each agent's intention, which is the paper defines as the agent's future behaviour without considering the action of others. In the second phase of communication, the agents the produce a joint action. The authors then prove that monotonic improvement of the policy is independent of priority, and provide a bound on the performance loss associated with using a world model for the ordering.\n\nThe authors then evaluate SeqComm on MPE and SMAC tasks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strengths\n- The setting of adding some communication to CTDE is an interesting way to alleviate miscoordination and work in this area is welcome. \n- The paper is quite clearly written.\n- The authors include ablation studies to evaluate why their method works.\n- The matrix game in Figure 1 nicely illustrates why an order is theoretically useful. \n\n## Weaknesses\n\n- I'm not sure that I understand the setting. If agents can broadcast functions of their observations to all other agents, then how is that different from joint learning, where all agents can view the same joint observation? This seems to not be the CTDE setting at all to me, but instead joint learning. I understand that TarMAC [1] adopts a similar setting, but I would appreciate some clarification from the authors on how this differs from joint learning.\n- The communication-free baselines MAPPO and IPPO are not a fair comparison, and it is not clear that SeqComm's performance is better TarMAC or the random-priority ablation. The authors claim that their method clearly outperforms the ablations and TarMAC, but the gap is only slight and seems to be mostly within a standard deviation. \n- The authors do not compare with a centralised method such as PPO (but conditioning the policy on the joint observation and outputting the joint action). This seems strange given this is an obvious alternative to the method, and would require approximately the same communication.\n- The empirical evaluation is only over 4 SMAC maps, and no further results are included. This does not seem enough to provide convincing evidence of outperformance.",
