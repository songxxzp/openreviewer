            "summary_of_the_review": "The topic of resource-aware machine learning on specialized hardware is highly relevant. The paper gives a nice anecdotal overview over applications on actual hardware. As with many survey papers, the paper has no methodological, empirical, or theoretical contribution. It does, however, also not provide a structured overview or taxonomy, no discussion of common methodology or problems, and no comparison. Therefore, it has little relevance to the community.\n\nI suggest to build a taxonomy of open source hardware based on their capabilities and limitations and then map approaches to the hardware they are applicable to. These applications can then be exemplified by the examples already given in the paper. This would provide a structured overview over capabilities and limitations of current hardware, and the methods one can use on them.\n\nThere is a large body of work on data analysis, data mining, and machine learning on low-power devices [e.g., 1,2,3,4] and specifically machine learning at the edge [e.g., 5,6,7], as well as distributed ML on low-power devices [8]. Evaluating which approaches could be applied on which hardware would be a great contribution.\n\nIn its current form, I vote for rejection, though.\n\n\n[1] Garofalakis, Minos, Daniel Keren, and Vasilis Samoladas. \"Sketch-based geometric monitoring of distributed stream queries.\" Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment 6.10 (2013): 937-948.\n[2] Piatkowski, Nico Philipp. Exponential families on resource-constrained systems.
