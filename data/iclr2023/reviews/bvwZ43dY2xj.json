The main idea is to constrain the norm and spectral radius of entity and relation embeddings, respectively. The authors provide thorough analyses to show that UniBi has theoretical superiority, strong robustness and interpretability, and competitive empirical results.",

The authors conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of UniBi.\n4. This paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n5. Detailed experimental settings and codes are provided, so the reproducibility looks nice.\n\n## Weaknesses\n1. **Motivation**   \n    I think the introduction to why we have to model the identity element can be further improved. Although many existing bilinear models cannot learn a unique identity element, is it necessary for a KGE model?  I have no idea about the relationship between this property and the final performance after reading the submission.\n2. **Experiments**    \n    In Section 5.2, the authors claim that results in Figure 3(c) verify the existence of problems shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b). However, I am wondering that if this result can verify the problem in Figure 1(b), since the imbalance degree eliminates the impact of the scale of the identity matrix.\n3. **Presentation**    \n    It seems that Definitions 1 and 2 are not used in the main text. Can we move them to the appendix?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper examines the properties of identity in bilinear models for knowledge encoding. To satisfy the properties, a modified bilinear model is proposed, in which the entity and relation embeddings are normalized. This form a unit ball. It is shown that the desired properties of unity can be met.\nIn the experiments on 3 datasets for relation prediction, the proposed model outperforms slightly the existing bilinear models and other knowledge graph embedding models.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The analysis of the identity properties is interesting. The proposed solution is simple, but makes sense.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, this investigation is interesting.\nFrom the perspective of experiments, the link between identity and better performance is not made. Despite the ablation studies, it is still difficult to see why satisfying identity would lead to better relation prediction performance. In other words, why the identity constraint would make the embeddings better representations of the entities and relations? It would be necessary to establish this connection for (1) a better understanding of the experimental results; (2) a better motivation for the proposed approach.\nAs stated in the paper (Appendix), normalization has been applied in some previous work. The only difference is that this paper uses a combination of entity normalization and spectral radius normalization for relations. In the demonstration that the existing methods do not satisfy identity, entities are not normalized. Does the demonstration still hold when entities are normalized?\nThe citations are in a form difficult to read. Instead of \"QuatE Zhang et al. (2019)\", it is better to write \"QuatE (Zhang et al. 2019)\".\nThe statements in the paper tend to be formal, which may make it more difficult to understand. \n\nAfter author's rebuttal:\n- In the rebuttal, the authors have explained some of the questions above. In particular, the motivation is better articulated.\nThe authors also mentioned the test about the impact of using the proposed normalization instead of another one. One experimental result is mentioned in appendix D, saying that MRR is reduced from 0.488 to 0.471 on WN18RR if spectral radius is replaced by orthogonal one. I think this should be one of the main results of the paper - showing the practical impact when the proposed normalization is replaced by another one. I would suggest to extend this experimental result to all the datasets, and incorporate them into the main body of the paper.\n- Despite the theoretical advantages, the overall effectiveness reported in Table 2 only shows marginal improvements. In particular, one can see that an existing approach RESCAL can obtain 0.495 in MRR on WN18RR. By comparing this with UniBi, it does not seem that the proper normalization, as proposed in this paper, is the most important (or the only key) factor that affect the effectiveness. \nIn summary, while the motivation is better explained, the experimental evidence about the importance of the proposed normalization is still weak.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Most part of the paper is clear. What is not very clear is why the proposed method can lead to experimental improvements.\nThe paper proposes a special schema of normalization to satisfy the identity properties. Considering the fact that embedding normalization has been often used in the literature, the novelty of the paper is limited (unless the difference is shown to be critical, which is not done in the paper).\nIt may be relatively difficult to reproduce the method, as the source code is not provided.\n\nAfter rebuttal:\nIt is true that the code is mentioned in appendix. Reproducibility is good.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper examines a specific property - identity. While theoretically interesting, its practical implication is not well explained. The experimental results are thus difficult to interpret.
