            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The overall arguments of the paper seem intuitive and correct. Although, the authors do not provide short overview of the proofs and the paper looks a bit jammed (better fits a journal paper). The paper heavily relies on the familiarity of the audience with the recent prior works such as (Bareinboim et al., 2022). Thus, some of the statements of the paper are unclear and need more explanations. E.g., \"Our treatment is constrained to recursive SCMs, which implies acyclic causal diagrams, with finite domains over V.\"\nThe use of the term neural seems to be mostly for marketing purposes and the results of the paper may hold for general function estimators. \n",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "As far as I understand, the main contribution is on theory. I suggest the authors emphasize what the challenge is for their main result. For example, for me, Thm. 1 seems to be an evident result, because the neural causal model is just to use many feedforward neural networks to model each causal mechanism P(V_i|pa(V_i)) according to my understanding of Def. 2. Could the authors give some intuition about why it is not evident, or does I miss or misunderstand some important facts?\n\nMy other questions:\n1. Could the authors explain \"It may be concerning that the true SCM $M^*$ might not be an NCM, as we alluded to earlier.\" further? Where does it allude?\n2. How to determine Line 4 of Alg. 1?\n3. Under the current framework, does the proposed algorithm only apply when the data is discrete?",
