            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to solve the challenging large batch size for contrast learning in unsupervised object detection pretraining. They conducted experiments with the Transformer-based detector and found that the diversity of proposals generated by the detector can effectively mitigate this problem. Thus, they propose ProSeCo, which improves the state-of-the-art on the fewer data pretraining task. They also propose a novel localization-aware proposal matching loss and apply it in the feature-consistent student-teacher architecture, which will be very useful for object detection. I think the precision of the proposed method is obviously improved, and the pre-training for unsupervised object detection deserves more in-depth study.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n+ The contributions are clearly illustrated and validated. The ablation experiments clearly reflect these contributions. I think ProSeCo is on the right way of exploration.\n+ The illustrations and explanations are clear.\n+ The proposed method outperforms others by a large margin.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n- In the Introduction, after analyzing the local feature consistency, there is no description of its application and advantages, and the relationship with the whole approach is not clearly elaborated.\n- The red part in Figure 3 is not clearly explained, which raises confusion.",

The method uses object proposals generated by Selective Search for contrastive learning, which avoids large batch requirement in the existing work. And the localization of the proposals are considered during sampling stage, to further improve the training efficiency. The proposed strategy shows clear improvement over baselines.",

The idea of using localization information to sample proposals for pre-training is interesting to me. Overall speaking I think it's a good paper. \n\nI have two questions of the paper: (i) what's the training time of the proposed method compared with the existing work. In addition to large batch training, the contrastive pre-training is also time-consuming; (ii) the proposed pre-training model is used for fsod, andI feel the proposed strategy is general and can also be applied in generic object detection. What's the performance for generic object detection? ",
