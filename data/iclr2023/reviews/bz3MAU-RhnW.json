The methodology is to replace the item embeddings in IDRec with the pre-trained item encoder in ModalityRec where the item encoder is BERT for item texts and ResNet/Swin-T for item images. Note, the user embeddings are the same for both IDRec and ModalityRec. The paper investigates two neural architectures, one is tower-based DSSM architecture and the other is sequence-based SASRec. The experiments are conducted under three scenarios, i.e., canonical scenario, cold-item scenario, and new-item scenario.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strong & Weak:\n\nS1: It is interesting to see what happened when the item embeddings are replaced by pre-trained item encoders like BERT and ResNet.\n\nW1: The ModalityRec method proposed in this paper is actually equivalent to the IDRec variants by replacing the item embeddings with pre-trained item encoders like BERT. However, using BERT/ResNet as the item encoder to represent item content has been proposed in Ref [1][2][3]. As a result, the two components of ModalityRec, IDRec architecture + pre-trained item encoders, are both not new. This weakens the contributions of ModalityRec.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zhang et al, UNBERT: User-News Matching BERT for News Recommendation, IJCAI\u201921.\n\n[2] Li et al, MINER: Multi-Interest Matching Network for News Recommendation, ACL\u201922 Findings.\n\n[3] Wu et al, MM-Rec: Multimodal News Recommendation, SIGIR\u201922\n",

For an ICLR paper, more than just proposing a general framework is required (it is quite easy for recommendation engineers or researchers to propose the framework if they are required to utilize modality in recommendation).\n2. The experimental results are not fully explained and analyzed. For example, the performance drop in DSSM when modality is utilized is not well explained. I prefer to attribute it to the weakness of the DSSM model rather than the non-sequential setting.\n3. Some experiments are not helpful since the conclusions are apparent.

IDRec has been dominating the recommender systems literature in the past decade due to its high flexibility. However, a recent trend in the recsys community is to use the recent advances in NLP and CV to build a powerful MoRec model. In particular, one of the promise of this approach is to develop of a general recommender system which can transfer its knowledge from a dataset to another. \nIn this paper, the authors propose an empirical comparison of the two approaches (IDRec vs MoRec). They compare two different model architectures (two-tower and sequential models) and several encoders (BERT, RoBERTa, Swin, etc.) on three datasets. \nThe main conclusion of this paper is that MoRec can be highly competitive with IDRec and benefits the recent advances in NLP and CV. \n\n",

In particular, the authors chose to compare:\n- 2 model architectures: DSSM (two-tower model) and SASRec (sequential model)\n- several encoders including BERT, RoBERTa, ResNet and Swin\n- 3 datasets, including one new dataset (Bili) on video recommendation - MIND (text), H&M and Bili (images)\n- several learning strategies: end-to-end training, frozen encoders, etc.\nThis kind of empirical comparison is useful for the recsys community. \n\nWeaknesses. There is no technical novelty in the paper and the empirical novelty is somewhat limited. There is a recent trend in integrating the recent advances of NLP to build a general recommender system. It would be great to include some technical challenges to improve the technical part of the paper, or to quantify the transfer skills of the MoRec approach. Some results are expected. For example, the cold-start is a known limitation of the IDRec setting.\n\nComments and questions.\n- Chose one acronym between MoRec and CoRec.\n- It can be useful to clarify the differences between the learning techniques. Many of them are introduced incrementally and it can lead to some confusions.\n- Table 2. Split the table into two parts (one for DSSM and one for SASRec) with one improvement column for each architecture.\n- Table 3. I am not sure to understand what the numbers in the column New item/IDRec represent. IDRec cannot learn an item embedding if there is no example available in the dataset. Therefore, is the embedding used for evaluation correspond to the random initialization? \n- DT layer. End-to-end training is shown to perform better than two-stage training (but is very expensive to train). One possible explanation is that the obtained representation with the encoder is not well aligned with the recommendation model. The DT layer is only a dense layer in the experiments. Does a better DT layer (using a neutral network) can improve the results of the two-stage approach?\n",
