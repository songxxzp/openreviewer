The proposed method relies on a pretrained object detection network that contains the sufficient semantic information for the in-distribution data. When the semantic of in-distribution data like medical images is not covered by the object detection network (pre-trained on natural image), the built semantic graph can be incomplete or even erroneous.

Defining these concepts in a more rigorous way would help the reader.\n\nThe authors summarize their work in the introduction. However it is not straightforward to relate this summary to the actual implementation.\nIt would be helpful if they better establish this relationship with the rest of the paper\n\n e.g.\n\"... Commonsense service that learns from experience\" \n By common-sense service are they alluding to their object detection models and relationship generator ?\nIs this \"experience\" their training data or they saying that they are creating a continuous learning system, which they aren't in this particular paper.\n\"computational models that mimic child cognition\"\nA strong reference which establishes the relationship with child cognition is necessary here.\nThe idea is intuitive and the authors claims are plausible, however the standard of this conference requires more rigorous demonstration of such claims.\n\nThe paper utilizes the performance reported in a reference to claim it is close to SoTA techniques. Typically such claims are validated by reproduction of the SoTA techniques for controlled comparisons.\n\nOne of the critical assumptions here is the accuracy of the object detection model. Though the authors have clarified that embedding extraction methods are susceptible to generate incorrect representations for out-of-domain data, they haven't provided an analysis of how the object detectors accuracy impacts the current model.

Figure. 1 in its current form looks representative but it is not clear if it qualifies as an actual example.\n\nNovelty of the paper lies in deriving visual semantic structures from images. It employs existing feature extraction techniques to convert these structures into representations suitable for training OOD detection models.\n\nThe paper utilizes an open dataset for experimental results, but the algorithm has not been described in detail sufficient for reproduction of the results.",
