The first one, PlaNet, use the local energy computed in each PESNET training step to train a surrogate model, which takes in the geometry of nucleus and output final energy, namely no dependence on electrons. At inference time, only the surrogate model is used to do prediction. Hence, the orders of magnitude for inference is faster than PESNet. The second one, PES++, includes several improvements to achieve better accuracy than PES with similar cost.",

PlaNet can approximate PESNET++ results well, but avoid the QMC inference phase, and thus can produce PES results much more efficiently.\n\nWeakness: The model is still limited, not applicable for real-world PES, for instance, molecular dynamics.\n\nSome questions to the authors: 1. Does PlaNet still have the variational property? 2. The neural Jastrow factor is not considering cusp condition as the traditional ones. Is it by design or just for convenience?",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to simulate the potential energy surfaces of atomic systems by accelerating the variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) approach. It builds on the PESNet by Gao and Gunnemann and contributes two major innovations: 1) it introduces PlaNet which trains a surrogate model to avoid the expensive Monte-Carlo integration; 2) it introduces PESNet++ which improves multiple aspects of the PESNet. It shows 7 orders of magnitude acceleration and reduces the error up to 74%.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n- PlatNet introduces an online learning scheme that learns a PES using the noisy labels from the VMC optimization. This innovation is significant because it enables the use of the very noisy energy data from VMC.\n- Multiple innovations are introduced to improve the PESNet++, which results in a new SOTA in VMC for several molecules.\n\nWeakness:\n- The motivation of learning a surrogate PlaNet from VMC optimization is unclear. From my understanding, the authors first use VMC to explore the entire PES and use the noisy data generated in the process to train a surrogate PlatNet. Since the entire PES has already been explored with VMC, why do we need a surrogate PatNet to predict the PES again? One argument may be that PatNet can generalize to new configurations that are not simulated by VMC. In that case, the authors probably should compare with a baseline DimeNet++ that is trained on the clean PES data from VMC to demonstrate the advantage of learning from noisy VMC energy.\n- The generalization performance of PlaNet is not studied in this paper. In Figure 3, 4, the PESNet++ simulated configurations are extremely dense and PlatNet only interpolates between nearby points. \nThe discussion on the results in Table 3 is slightly misleading. It is unfair to compare the training/inference time of the surrogate model to VMC, because the latter requires the former to generate data. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The writing of this paper is overall clear and high-quality. However, it combines two slightly independent contributions (PlaNet and PESNet++) into a single paper. The narration could be improved to better clarify the connection between the two contributions.\n- The paper introduces multiple innovations for both the PlatNet and PESNet++ to improve the PESNet architecture. The novelty of individual innovations are not very high, but they are combined to solve the important challenge of VMC and achieve the SOTA in several molecules.\n- The source code is not provided for review. I presume that the code will be provided possibly upon acceptance, because the paper says code will be open.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In summary, the paper makes two contributions: 1) a PlaNet that learns a PES from the noisy data of VMC; 2) a PESNet++ that improves PESNet and achieves SOTA in several molecules. I think the motivation of 1) needs to be further clarified and additional baseline may be required. Contribution 2) alone makes significant progress in the ab-initio modeling of molecules. The paper may be accepted based on contribution 2) but the paper needs to be significantly revised. I give a score of 5 for now, but I am open to increase my score after satisfying responses from the authors.",
