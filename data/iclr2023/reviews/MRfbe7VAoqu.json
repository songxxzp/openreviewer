            "summary_of_the_paper": "Authors propose a method for sequential generation of Lego models. This addresses two tasks \u2013 (i) generating new class-conditional Lego models a priori; (ii) completing partial models. The proposed approach consists of a neural network to predict how good candidate locations for the 'next' brick is, and various checks to ensure constraints on fabricability are fulfilled. The method is demonstrated on shapes from the ModelNet dataset, and shown to perform favorably versus the chosen baselines.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "- the first task considered is generation of models of certain object classes, from Lego. However, this is straightforwardly accomplished by using an existing generative model of ModelNet shapes (outputting any representation that can be converted to voxels), then applying Brickr [Testuz, Eurographics 2013] to convert this to a valid Lego model. That approach already supports many more brick types than the proposed method, and supports all the relevant constraints.\n\n- the second task considered is completing partial lego models of ModelNet classes. This can again be addressed easily using existing techniques \u2013 convert to a point cloud, run a point-cloud completion model, convert back to voxels, and run Brickr on the 'new' part, giving the uppermost part of the input model as the first Brickr layer.\n\n- very few qualitative generation examples are given (three examples from two classes) \u2013 making it impossible to judge whether generated shapes are in fact reasonable. Those which are given, are not particularly impressive, and it's not specified whether they are curated.\n\n- there is no quantification (based on nearest-neighbors) of whether the method is in fact generating novel shapes, or simply memorising its training set\n\n- the constraints in sec. 3 need more explanation. Do they correctly disallow 'squeezing in' blocks? Why must structure be fully-connected from start (submodules assembled separately then combined are common in real Lego)?\n\n- the overall approach is a complex engineered pipeline, very specific to the task, and most stages of this are (in my opinion) not of great interest to the majority of the ICLR community\n\n- stochasticity in the generative process appears to be introduced only by randomly selecting which of a candidate set of points to consider at each step. This is fine a-priori; however, the set of candidates appears to be determined not by the learnt model directly, but by the number of possible locations that bricks could be affixed to them. Why not let the model learn the distribution over 'next' attachment points? Also, why is the selection of 'pivot brick' artificially separated from choosing which particular location on this brick to attach to?\n",

Within the pipeline, all the components are fairly standard\n\n- it appears that sufficient details are given to allow reimplementation of the proposed method (particularly if the authors make the code public as promised)\n",

The main contributions are:\n- A parallelizable brick position predictor and validator based on convolution filters, making the inference of the proposed brick sequence generation method efficient on GPU for large brick structures.\n- The proposed method is agnostic to the brick type, with experimental demonstrations of assembling structures using both 2x4 and 2x2 bricks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- Technically sound methodology. The technical flow in Figure 1 is intuitive.\n- Good empirical performance in terms of shape completion accuracy, semantic generation quality, validity, and efficiency compared to baselines.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper is poorly written with confusing logic, and the task definition is unclear until the end of the paper. Such poor clarity is unacceptable for more potential readers. See more details below.\n- The wider impact or applications of the research problem are not clear. Though the authors believe this method can be extended to building design or industrial robots, the proposed method seems highly specific to LEGO bricks and hard to extend.\n\nPaper writing and clarity issues:\n- The abstract does not illustrate which problem/goal specifically you are targeting. Obviously, you are working on brick sequence generation, but is the generation conditioned on certain target shapes or shape classes? From the current abstract, it seems to be that you are generating ANY assembly sequence that satisfies the physical constraints, which confused me because I don't see why you need such a complicated approach to achieve that.\n- The detailed definitions of completion and generation tasks are only vaguely described in Sec 5.1-5.2. In other words, most of the time when I was reading the paper, I didn't have a clear clue of which specific problem the authors were addressing. The terms \"completion task\" and \"generation task\" are frequently used in the middle of the paper without explanation. So please bring the task definitions forward - let people know what you are addressing even before describing the technical approach.\n\nQuestions:\n- Sec 4.1.3 details the pivot brick selection procedure, where the authors propose sampling to avoid being deterministic. This is reasonable for the novel structure generation task. But for the shape completion task, does adding stochasticity help?\n- In Sec 4.2, I am not sure if I understand this correctly: \"By replacing $B_t^{'}$ with a ground-truth voxel occupancy, we generate an assembly sequence ...\". Would you mind elaborating more on this procedure?",

The\ndifference is that the proposed method can be easily parallelized on GPUs. If my understanding is correct, the computation for different candidate shapes can be carried out in parallel regardless of the assembly technique. In principle, the other techniques could be parallelized, right?  \n\n---\n\n    \"To tackle the limitations above, we devise a novel brick assembly method with a U-shaped sparse\n    3D convolutional neural network utilizing a convolution filter to validate complex brick constraints\n    efficiently.\"\n\nWhat is the intuition though?

Have you considered (and performed ablation studies with) different architectures?\n\n---\n\n    \"BrECS performs the best with 117% higher average classification scores than the next best one.\"\n\nI have no idea what 117% higher average classification score\nmeans. Does it mean \"more than twice as accurate\"? I wouldn't report\nnumerical results here. Even if the metric is well-known or clearly\nexplained, it is not really useful to the reader at this point.\n\n\n---\n\n    \"Unlike the sequential brick problem, a sequential part assembly\n    problem also shares similar difficulties to the combinatorial\n    optimization problem [...]\"\n\nUnlike? Is 'sequential brick problem' different than 'sequential brick\nASSEMBLY problem'?

Can the proposed approach accomodate any constraint\nbesides the ones considered here (e.g. constraints on the frequency of\ncertain blocks, or budgets)? My intuition is that filtering out infeasible configurations with convolutions only works for a restricted number of constraints, but I might be wrong.\n\n---\n\n**Experiments**\n\n    \"Generated sequences are unique and diverse, since the\n    stochasticity is injected from the sampling strategy introduced in\n    Section 4.1.3.\"\n\nIsn't uniqueness implying diversity?

Long assembly sequences with a wide branching factor can be difficult to control, and the presented results look quite good considering this challenge. The method guarantees that the assemblies are valid by construction. The training is also self-supervised and does not appear to use explicit GT construction sequences.\n\nThat said, the (not great in absolute terms) quality of the results does leave one wondering if combining a voxel-based generator with a subsequent (non-ML) step that fits an arrangement of bricks to the voxel pattern would be a better way to generate (still structurally valid) assemblies of Lego bricks, rather than to impose distributional constraints on very long Markov sequences. The presented method is an interesting technical demo of controlling long assembly sequences with tight constraints, but its practical utility in the context of Lego construction seems limited. Autoregressive methods have their place, but in this case it seems like a particularly challenging paradigm to employ, and there don't seem to be obvious takeaways transferable to other sequential assembly problems. The \"Potential Applications\" section mentions building construction and robotic assembly, and in each of these tasks there seem to be easier ways to achieve the end goal.\n\nFinally, even though the paper claims that the assembly sequences are ones humans can actually follow (\"can... provide instructions to build the structure\"), the sequences don't actually take things like phsyical stability and connection strength of intermediate structures into account, so this may not be true in all cases.\n",
