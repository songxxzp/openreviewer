            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents an approach for real-time demoire on mobile devices.  Demoireing is an interesting (and hard) problem of removing moire patterns from images, which can easily appear due to high frequency patterns in the scene interfering with the camera color filter array.  It is hard because the moire patterns span a large set of frequencies and colors.  The paper proposes to divide the image into patches, and for each patch assess its moire complexity.  The complexity of the demoire network is adaptive based on the moire complexity; with easier to handle patches receiving less computation compared to harder ones.  This way, the approach can provide the computation where it\u2019s needed, saving unnecessary computations on easy patches.  This is implemented using a supernet approach, and shown to save computation.  Experimental results show improved PSNR and runtime on the FHDMi dataset, and slightly lower PSNR but improved runtime on the LCDMoire dataset compared to MBCNN.  However the method outperforms DMCNN on both datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Demoireing of images is an interesting and hard problem, recently receiving attention in the computer vision community particularly through the use of deep learning techniques.  As argued by the paper, it is common to take photographs of screens using a smartphone, but the resulting image may be corrupted by moire patterns.  They can occur anytime high frequency patterns interfere with the camara color filter array.  This paper addresses the challenge of real-time demoire as existing approaches have focused primarily on demoire performance and not speed.  The method adopts the supernet strategy to dynamically process patches based on their moire complexity.  The more complex patches receive more computation compared to simpler ones.  The moire complexity is estimated by combining frequency and color estimators together into a score applied to patches.  The score is novel although its components are fairly well established.  The paper shows improvements in speed are possible using the supernet approach.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1.\tThe paper is the first to address real-time moire.  The paper doesn\u2019t really describe why real-time performance is needed however.  Conceivable for photographs, if it takes up to 500 ms to demoire an image most users won\u2019t notice as there is a lag between taking the photo and reviewing the captured photo.  Perhaps the real-time moire is important for video processing.  Perhaps the paper could articulate why real-time more is important, although it seems likely that real-time demoire has more use cases than a slower demoire approach.\n\n2.\tThe method to characterise the patches in terms of their moire complexity is interesting.  The ranking in Figure 2 is compelling, with the severity of the moire pattern increasing from left to right.  The examples in Figure 2 seem to be mostly grayscale however; it would be more convincing if they were more colorful as color is one of the measurements in the scoring criteria.\n\n\n3.\tThe paper appears to be the first to apply a supernet approach to demoire.  This provides a practical approach to reduce computational complexity to perform fast demoire, by applying the computation where it is most needed.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1.\tThe paper seems to overstate the problem given the relative improvement produced by the proposed technique.  For example, in the abstract, the paper describes existing networks \u201ccausing massive computation burden\u201d.  In Table 1, DMCNN requires 69.4ms latency whereas DDA requires 48.0ms.  DDA is certainly an improvement, but if DMCNN is a massive computation burden one might wonder if DDA also could be described similar as it is only 31% faster.  Perhaps the language could be toned down.\n\n2.\tPage 2, the paper claims that existing methods bring about side effect, such as over-whitened image contents.  However, the results don\u2019t seem to show this, and indeed MBCNN seems to have better PSNR on LCDMoire than the proposed method.  It would be more convincing if this claim was substantiated somehow, for example in the results section. \n\n3.\tThe paper has novelty in the way it scores patches in terms of their moire complexity and then uses a supernet architecture, however it relies on components derived from other papers. \n\n4.\tSome clarity issues raise hold the paper back.  Clarity is discussed in the next section.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper\u2019s clarity could be improved in places.  Some of these points may relate to things not discussed in the paper and impact reproducibility:\n\n1.\tSome patches will have no moire patterns.  How does the supernet deal with these?  Perhaps there could be a \u201cpassthrough\u201d option for patches that have no moire, they require no processing at all by the demoire network.\n\n2.\tThe network architecture of DDA isn\u2019t so clear.  How does the supernet split the computation for demoire?  It appears the supernet is also applied to MBCNN, but it wasn\u2019t clear to this reviewer how this is achieved, as MBCNN is a multi-scale architecture and not so easy to split into different computational blocks.  Perhaps the author rebuttal can comment on this.\n\n3.\tWhat are the parameters used to compute Equation 2?  For example, the parameters of the Gaussian high pass kernel?  Without describing these it because difficult to reproduce the paper.\n\n4.\tIt wasn\u2019t clear if the source code and pretrained models will be released should the paper be accepted.\n\n5.\tAfter Equation 5, the paper states that output patches are concatenated to reconstruct the full image.  In this reviewer\u2019s experience, doing this type of processing may result in artifacts at patch boundaries, because each patch was processed independently by the network.  Are such artifacts present in the proposed results?  How to handle these artifacts?\n\n6.\tIn Table 2, MBCNN performs best on LCDMoire in terms of PSNR and SSIM.  It would be best to make it bold in this table.  Usually a bold font is used to denote the best performing method.\n\n\nThe main originality comes from the supernet approach and how patches are characterized.  The supernet appears in other literature.  The characterization of patches is interesting and has some novelty, although the components in the score are known.  The paper has some novel elements but may read more as a systems paper bringing together known concepts into a practical working algorithm.\n\nSmaller issues: \n\n\u2022\tThroughout the paper, please use \u201ccomplexity\u201d when discussing computation.

Please note this issue appears several times in the paper, not just the abstract.\n\n\u2022\tPage 1, the phrase \u201con offline mobile devices\u201d seems unusual.  In what sense are the mobile devices offline?  Note most smartphones have accelerators capable of running neural networks.  Perhaps the word \u201coffline\u201d can be removed.  \n\n\u2022\tPage 1, please change \u201ccontaminated by the moire.\u201d to \u201ccontaminated by the moire pattern.\u201d\n\n\u2022\tPage 2, please change \u201cDetailedly,\u201d to \u201cIn detail,\u201d\n\n\u2022\tPage 2, please change \u201cresource-hungry\u201d to \u201cresource-limited\u201d\n\n\u2022\tPage 3, please change \u201cpioneer work\u201d to \u201cpioneering work\u201d.

            "summary_of_the_review": "In summary, this paper is addressing an important and difficult problem of demoire.  The supernet approach, coupled with the way to find moire-contaminated patches is interesting and has some (limited) novelty.  The faster results are appreciated by this reviewer, and real-time performance may have important use cases, however these are not articulated in the paper.  The paper seems overly critical of previous work given its results underperform MBCNN on one dataset and are 31% faster than DMCNN on another dataset.  Nonetheless, the paper reflects an advance on the problem on fast demoire, and the paper is the first to explicitly address this problem.  The paper is held back due to clarity issues, which impact reproducibility. ",

This is important as current methods are extremely costly, and cannot therefore be embedded in current devices. The authors propose to first, divide the image into patches, second, given a proposed Moire prior, classify the patches according to the level of Moire that is presented in them, and third, process ech of this patches depending on the Moire level. In orer to make this efficient and to not fight with the parameter burden; the authors propose to have a supernet -in particular a Vanilla Net-, which allows the share of weights for the subnetworks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strenghts:\n- The idea is interesting, and addresses a real problem in current mobile devices. Dividing the patches according the level of Moir\u00e9 is clearly and advantage, even for obtaining better results -as shown in Tables 1 and 2, because it avoids the over-whitening of the clear parts of the images.\n\n- As already mentioned, the results are state-of-the-art or very close to it, with a reduction of FLOPs of around 50%.\n\n- Also the paper is mostly well written (although I would put section 4.3.1 just after 4.1.4).\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The authors write about the color part of the Moir\u00e9 prior (Eq.1) in a way that shows clearly that they have not put enough attention on understanding the color part. They just select one equation from another paper and give a light -to not say worng- explanation of it. Let me detail this. Authors say that the used a measure in the CIELAB color space... but the equation they present is in RGB color space. I agree when studying the equation, that it is definitelu inspired in an opponent color space -from which CIELAB is an example-, because of the relations applied between the R,G, and B channels... However, the CIELAB color space is a non-linear transform from RGB, and in the equation presented here, there is not a non-linearity! I strongly recommend the authors to rewrite this part, stating that they apply a Colorfulness formula on the RGB color space, that is inspired in the chromatic -because luminance is clearly ignored- part of color opponent spaces.\n\n- Regarding to the previous comment (Eq. 1), even if the formula comes from another paper, authors need to briefly explain why there is a relation of 0.3 to 1 in the standard deviation and the mean.\n\n-  In Eq.3, authors need to clarify who is $\\mu$. Is it the mean after computing the high-pass filter? Also, if that is the case, I am surprised about how well both measures combine... as there is a direct multiplication of both. Are they therefore on the same order of magnitude? That should be stated. If not, one may lead to thing that if one is much more larger than the other, will be clearly dominating the prior, and that will mean than the other term is actually meaningless.\n\n- Finally, as the paper are basing their Moir\u00e9 Prior in some color measure, I believe they should at least add one color metric to their results. I recommend CIE DeltaE.",

Even if it seems quite a straighforward idea; it was not proposed before, and that is actually a very positivie thing.\n\n- The authors seems quite straigforward to reproduce, although I would strongly encourage the authors to release their code -there are not comment on that in the manuscript-.\n\n",
