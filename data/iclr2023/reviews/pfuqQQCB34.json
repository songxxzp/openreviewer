Meanwhile, communication compression is a bonus of the proposed method. The authors provide theoretical analysis of Byz-VR-MARINA for non-convex objective functions and the functions satisfying Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Besides, empirical results of Byz-VR-MARINA and the baselines on binary classification tasks are provided.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The main idea of variance reduction is well presented. I appreciate that theoretical analysis is provided for both non-convex objective functions and functions satisfying PL inequality. Meanwhile, there are also some concerns.\n\n1. My major concern is about the proof details. The expectation notation $\\mathbb{E}$ is used ambiguously in the proof details in the Appendix. Specifically, the randomness comes from both the stochastic mapping $\\mathcal{Q}$ and the mini-batched estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}_i$. However, it is ambiguous which stochastic operator each expectation is with respect to. It increases the difficulty of checking the correctness of the proof details and would make readers confused.\n\n2. It is claimed that communication compression is a bonus of the proposed method. However, there seems no theoretical analysis or empirical results about the communication efficiency in the paper.\n\n3. The proposed method is very similar to VR-MARINA [1], which limits the novelty of this paper.\n\n4. The experiments are conducted with the logistic regression model on a9a and w8a datasets. The scale of the problem is small given the current computing power and the background of distributed learning. Adding experiments on larger-scale problems would make this work more solid and convincing.\n\n5. (minor) It seems that only the proofs for the generalized version of Theorem 2.1 and 2.2 are provided in the Appendix. It is suggested to add some details in the Appendix about how to obtain the final results when $B=0$ in Assumption E.1.\n\n6. (minor) I am wondering why the hyperparameter setting for bucketing is presented in the paragraph that introduces the attack method IPM (page 9).\n\n[1] Gorbunov, Eduard, et al. \"MARINA: Faster non-convex distributed learning with compression.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

They also refused to provide clear technical definitions that would not rely on a medieval prejudice in order to convey a technical scientific meaning in the 21st century.\n\nThereby, the authors insisted on using the essence of the pejorative term. The three-letter term offered (at times interchangeably with terms \"bad\" and \"malicious\") does not make things clearer. The kind of workers envisaged in the work are only described by reference to previous work, but their properties are not made clear and are not defined technically. The only definition given is the following on Page 1:\n\n\"there is a high risk that some participants deviate from the prescribed protocol either on purpose or not.\"\n\nThereafter, despite this formulation and disclaimer about the motives of the workers in question, the workers are still characterized interchangeably as \"bad\" and \"malicious\". The short definition given is scientifically insufficient and does include all the intended technical connotations of the term, as the authors also acknowledged. Nevertheless, even this definition, short and technically insufficient as it may be, lends itself to a neutral technical term. That is the term \"deviant\". The authors declined using such a technical term and insisted that the paper somehow required using a derogatory stereotype that ACM recommends avoiding, shortened to three letters.\n\nYet such terminology is technically unclear and ambiguous. Alluding to a pejorative dictionary definition of an ethnoreligious exonym, distorting even the way Lamport used it in 1982, does not make the term technically clearer. The claim that it does so is scientifically dubious. These authors seem to believe that science should use derogatory stereotypes presented as technical terms to move forward.

In fact, they even insisted that alluding to such a prejudice is necessary to convey the intended technical neaning\n\nTherefore, unfortunately, the core definitions and terms employed remain wanting clarity and scientific precision, and there have not been solid rectification steps; the authors also bluntly refused using any of the alternative terms suggested and to provide the definitions requested by this reviewer.\n\nIn particular, the authors disputed that the use of language in their original submission, which violates ACM guidelines on the matter, was ambiguous and potentially offensive. They argued that using an ethnoreligous term with a derogatory meaning as scientific terminology is fine as long as it is abbreviated to its first three letters. They used as their main piece of evidence the fact that this term was not offensive to themselves. They declined to engage in further discussion and to respond to either the scientific or the ethical concerns raised. They expressed open disagreement regarding the ambiguity and lack of scientific clarity in the definitions employed and decided to do nothing more about it, contrary to ACM guidelines.\n\nNevertheless, I appreciate the dedicated scientific effort made by the authors to provide additional results comparing with alternative variance-reducing methods as they could. I also appreciate their willingness to rectify the terminological ambiguity and omit allusions to an enduring cultural prejudice of medieval origin that have no place in a peer-reviewed academic article, albeit only superficially.

            "details_of_ethics_concerns": "Starting with the title, the paper uses an offensive term that the Association for Computing Machinery recommends be avoided in professional writing and presentations: https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter\n\nDespite the progress that has been made on this front over the last few years, it occasionally appears that, unfortunately, some people believe that it is necessary to explicitly and literally invoke the practice of slavery to describe a property of a distributed system architecture. Such people believe that the term \"m_ster-sl_ve\" is inherently better than several excellent, more respectful, more objective, more precise, and more meaningful alternatives proposed, and that those alternatives are, to quote the way some people usually put it, \"ridiculous\". In a similar fashion, as the response of the authors suggests, it seems there are people who find it necessary to explicitly and recognizably invoke an offensive and disrespectful enduring cultural prejudice of medieval European origin to describe a property of a distributed system or some of its constituent parts. According to those people, none of the reasonable, respectful, objective, and more meaningful alternatives proposed are good enough to describe those properties. Moreover, such authors do so in a convoluted manner that lacks scientific rigor, as they do not distinguish between the description of a system as a whole and the description of its faulty or deviant constituent parts. They refuse to provide a technically more precise definition, claiming that the prejudice-inspired term conveys the technical meaning in the best possible way. In the view of this reviewer, this practice is questionable from both a scientific and an ethical viewpoint, as it appears to denote a lack of scientific rigor as well as a lack of cultural sensitivity.\n\nThis paper uses the derogatory exonym \"Byzantines\", in its noun form, according to a pejorative meaning found in English dictionaries, to denote malicious or otherwise deviant workers, to whom an \"antidote\" should be given. The derogatory meaning of this English exonym reflects a centuries-old cultural and ethnoreligious prejudice (see, for example, https://hortulus-journal.com/journal/volume-13-2-2017/johnson/). This term was chosen in 1982 (see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/byzantine-generals-problem/, which describes the term as \"obviously more appropriate\", alluding to the dictionary definition that reflects the prejudice), before the ICLR Code of Ethics was written. However, even then, it was used to describe a set of all workers, rather than a subset of deviant, deceptive, demonic, malicious, devious, dishonest, or deceitful workers in the context of the properly named interactive consistency problem. The English exonym signifies the cultural heritage and identity of millions of people, including underrepresented and persecuted minorities. For example, it signifies members of the Eastern Catholic Church hailing from Eastern Europe (e.g., Albania, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and elsewhere), who ecclesiastically identify themselves as \"Byzantines\" (see the usage at https://www.byzcath.org/index.php/about-us-mainmenu-60/about-byzantines-mainmenu-62; see also, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Greek_Catholic_Church, https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Slovak_Greek_Catholic_Church, etc.), members of the persecuted Rumlar/Byzantine community of Istanbul (formerly Byzantium, see, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_in_Turkey#Current_situation, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_pogrom), and others, and it is used as a cultural signifier interchangeably with the English exonym \"Greek\" (see, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Byzantine_scholars_in_Renaissance&redirect=no). Using a signifier for all these people and their cultural heritage in its pejorative and prejudiced sense, as a synonym for \"bad\" and \"malicious\", to which an \"antidote\" needs to be given, as this paper does starting with such a call in the title, violates the standards of respectful, tolerant, inclusive, and equitable use of language that our community is trying to establish and the ICLR Code of Ethics advises to abide by. Therefore ACM recommends that this term be avoided in professional writing and presentations.\n\nUnfortuntely, in their response, the authors expressed the view that using the pejorative and derogatory dictionary definition of an ethnoreligious term reflecting a medieval prejudice as scientific terminology was not self-evidently offensive. They refused to use scientifically neutral, objecgtive, and respectful alternative terms that carry the intended meaning with technical precision and may also be defined accordingly, such as, for example, deviant, deceptive, devious, deceitful, dishonest, demonic, treacherous, labyrinthine, etc. This stance deviates from the ICLR Code of Ethics, which explicitly advises respecting the cultural heritage of others, as in using tolerant, inclusive, and equitable scientific and technical language, hence avoiding the endorsement of prejudices by using derogatory ethnoreligious terms as scientific terminology.\n\nThe authors also argued that the attributes assigned to the ethnoreligious term used as a technical term include, apart from the antidote-calling qualities of being bad, malicious, dishonest, and deceitful, also the quality of being omniscient. This argument indicates the authors appreciate the offensive and disrespectful character of the term in question, yet believe that is amplified by including a positive characteristic in the mix. It seems to this reviewer that such arguments ridicule the spirit and the intent of the ICLR Code of Ethics.",

Another question is that for those convergence rates marked with x in Table 2, is it impossible to establish? Or the original paper did not report?

Although Bryd-SAGA uses additional memory, but the datasets e.g., a9a, is small and such memory consumption is affordable. Even if Bryd-SAGA is not a good choice to compare with, the authors can compare to heuristics such as Bryd-SARAH / Bryd \u2013 SVRG.  **ii)** The numerical experiments do not reflect the influences of gradient compression.

Is it optimal?\n    - Eq. (7) suggests that while variance reduction improves the convergence rate but at the same time makes the lower bound worse. Is there any way we can circumvent this? The overparameterization trick in (Karimireddy et al., 2021) seems not working as it increases the gradient size.\n\n",
