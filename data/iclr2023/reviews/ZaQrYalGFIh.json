A graph is monophilous if the label of a node is similar to that of its neighbors\u2019 neighbors.  To this end, it proposes two stages label propagations to meet the monophily property. Experimental evaluations show the marginal performance improvement.\n",

Many components are redundant, such as the propagation formula in main body, algorithm and figure 1.\n- Some parts of the paper is not clear, such as the meaning of Figure 3.\n- The experimental evaluations are insufficient.

The paper and the algorithm are both difficult to follow and understand.\n2. Since scalability is the primary goal, some information on training time, memory usage etc. would have been useful.\n3. Albeit, the related work cites several papers, but comparison seems to drop them due to the fact that these methods are not scalable. However, there are a few datasets of fairly small size in the experiment, so at least for those, the numbers for these other methods can still be reported, if only to understand whether there is a trade-off involved between accuracy and scalability, and how much is it?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper writing can be improved significantly. \n1. How is a graph treated as a Knowledge Graph? Simply saying that one learns Pytorch Biggraph embedding seems to be pointless. Why does it make sense to treat a general graph as a Knowledge Graph? How does it encode positional information? \n2. Many odd typos. For example, Algorithm 1 says Loss is maximized. I am assuming it should be minimized. Also, the notations can be improved to understand what they are. For example, Algorithm 1 says \"learn distribution of a node's neighbors\", but the y's are still running over the training data. So, it is extremely confusing, where is the neighbor information? What is backward label propagation in stage 3? the expression seems identical to the stage 2.\n3. Why does this method capture long range information which is required for heterophily? There seems to some justification in Theorem 2, but the Theorem 2 statement is hard to follow and understand. However, it still seems that the model is utilizing 2 hop information. However, does that mean that the paper is claiming that 2-hop information is sufficient for heterophily? How does one prove this?\n4. Comparisons with non-scalable models can still be done for smaller datasets, if only to understand the trade-off between scalability and accuracy.\n5. Include training time, memory usage etc. information to show the scalability aspect of the model.\n\nThe novelty aspects are difficult to determine and lack of clarity makes the work hard to reproduce.",
