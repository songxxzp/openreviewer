This is an interesting problem and worth a deeper investigation and the proposed methodology seems to be a reasonable candidate.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of learning a dynamical process given sparse observations of the process at intermediate times using a modification of the Schrodinger bridge process. In particular, the authors propose a method they term Iterative Smoothing Bridge (ISB) which alternates fitting forward and backward drifts parametrized by neural networks with a particle filtering and update step. This latter step is included to incorporate potentially sparse observations of the intermediate time dynamics. The authors discuss connections between their methods and stochastic control and give some theoretical claims. They then give an empirical study of their method.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- They study an important problem: that of learning dynamical processes given some sparse observations at intermediate times\n\n- The ISB method is novel\n\n- They achieve some improved empirical results when compared against related methods in the literature\n\n- The work is fairly well written\n\nWeaknesses:\n- While their method does offer some improvement compared to related methods, it is not a significant improvement, see for example table 2, figure 6, figure 7\n\n- The authors give little theoretical justification for their method, beyond Prop. 3 which is not rigorously proved and in any case is essentially well-known. \n\n- The core elements of the method appeared in prior works, namely De Bortoli et al 2021 and Corenflos et al 2021. The novelty of their method is in the combination of these approaches.\n\nWriting feedback:\n- Typos in background paragraph on page 3: should be $\\mathcal{C} = C([0, T]; \\mathbb{R}^d)$. There's an extra \"to\" in the sentence that begins with $x_t$\n- The differentiable re-sampling procedure is hardly explained at all, and only a passing reference to Corenflos et al is given. Comprehension would be greatly aided by giving some discussion of this method, if only in an appendix. Also, it seems that the differentiability of the re-sampling method is not used in your method - is this correct?\n\nDe Bortoli, V., Thornton, J., Heng, J., & Doucet, A. (2021).
