There are limited details in terms of the dataset used for training and how the system is actually deployed after training.\n\nThe system is evaluated with synthetic data and real-world satellite images. It is unclear if the proposed solution generalizes to images that are \"different\" from those used in the training set.\n",

It is unclear if the methods is generalizable to different environments. This is not really evaluated in the paper (or at least it is not explicitly described in the paper).\n- The reference to MuZero and the description of its application is quite hard to understand, especially in relation to the definition of the rewards. The same applies to the use of a MCTS, which is also only sketched in my opinion. \n- The reviewer was not able to understand how the RL is actually trained. In fact, it is unclear if the RL system is evaluated using the same dataset used for training. \n- The authors refer a learnable model of a dynamics network G, but it is difficult to map it to the actual inputs (and outputs) of the model.\n- The values of the metrics used in the evaluation have very similar values. I believe that the authors should indicate the confidence intervals of these values. The confidence intervals might be overlapping.\n- The authors should present the trade-off of the proposed methods in terms of computational complexity. Is the proposed method computationally expensive compared to the existing ones?\n- There is limited information about the potential actual deployment post-training in terms of information needed as input. The authors should also clarify the outputs that are provided by the system in a clearer way in my opinion.\n- The reviewer was not able to understand the concept of \"dreamt tree search\" presented in Figure 11.\n",

The reviewer was not able to understand the training process (and dataset) used by the authors. It is also unclear if there is any overlap between the training and evaluation datasets.\n\nThe presentation style of this work can be improved: in fact, some aspects are described in very generic terms and not in relation to the specific problem (in particular the use of MCTS and the application of MuZero in this situation).\n\nIn general, the reproducibility of the work is somehow limited since the description of the use of MuZero and MCTS is only sketched. The steps needed for the training and deployment of the system are also described in very abstract terms.",

Unfortunately, some key information around the training and deployment of the system are missing. The descriptions of MCTS and MuZero are not completely clear (especially in relation the actions and inputs/outputs of the model).\n\nThe performance results do not show significant differences and it is difficult to evaluate them without confidence intervals. Other methods provide better performance in some situations.\n\nIt is very difficult to understand if the method generalizes to images that are different from the training set. The authors do not clearly specify if the training and test sets contain similar satellite images. \n\nThis is a promising paper, but it is difficult to recommend acceptance in its current version.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a reinforcement learning approach to road vectorization. In contrast with previous works, the task is modeled as generating a graph as a variable-length edge sequence. \n\nThe pipeline consists of multiple stages: semantic segmentation from RGB images (this results in binary maps), a transformer-based autoregression model (results in a collection of road graphs) and the RL part- muZero adapted for road graph extraction. It achieves competitive performance on DeepGlobe and SpaceNet datasets.\n\nThe authors also introduce a synthetic dataset that helps pretraining the autoregression model (need to clarify with the authors on that).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths\n- competitive performance on two public datasets\n- interesting synthetic dataset with path occlusion difficulty analysis\n\n### Weaknesses\n- more recent [relevant] related work that yields much improved results such as RNGDet (ignored) or VecRoad (different split, mentioned but ignored) is not compared against; what do you mean by \"these baselines have been already shown to underperform though in the literature\"? Who has shown that and where?\n- small performance improvements on both datasets, seems to struggle at times, sometimes beaten by a 2017 paper\n- convoluted pipeline, RGB segmentation >> point extraction from sampling >> auto-regression model >> muZero; feels like the whole system was glued in place to fix the problems from the previous step (e.g., the sampled keypoints are not perfect, throw in the auto-regression transformer model; its graphs are not that great, throw in the RL to figure out which graphs are usable); why not try predicting the graph directly?\n- using RL for navigation / computing routes is not novel; for example, [1*] presented a similar concept, but with street views instead of satellite images.\n\n\n___\n[1*]Mirowski, P., Grimes, M., Malinowski, M., Hermann, K.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity/quality: \n\nAs previously stated, the pipeline consist of a number of methods mashed together. Even an overview is missing - Fig 1 describes muZero modeling, which is a tiny bit of the whole pipeline. IMHO the authors need to test a modern architecture, such as RNGDet and check if RL improves on top of that. If not, well, RL is not the way to go for this task. Especially looking at the RNGNet results, I do not see compelling evidence the authors would be able to come close to those numbers, even with the complex system they built on top of the (already existing) graphs.\n\nThe paper has only minor text issues - e.g., Fig 6. \"imporovement\" x2, it is well written and structured. \n\nNovelty:\n\nAll in all, I do not think this paper in its current form is ICLR-worthy. It is more of an engineering work that struggles to marginally improve the results. Judging from the ablation study, they start from a terrible baseline, which again, in 2022, it is unacceptable. If my calculator is right, the 0.455 ALPS is the method without any improvements. Why? If the focus is the RL agent, why not start with the best graphs possible and improve over them? Is it something here that I am missing?\n\nThe synthetic dataset could be used to improve the results and show a compelling advantage for RL, but it's not. In fact, it's not even clear on how it's used, they claim the generation of a 'difficulty' score and training with LinkNet [a 2017 method], but only Figure 6 supports this claim, and no other attempts to find a meaningful use are described (e.g., is the autoregressive pretrained done on this dataset? What about other ideas, such as style transfer, or use to train the RL agent? Or is it this already done but not mentioned?).\n\nFew recent approaches have attempted to upgrade the algorithms to modern pipelines (e.g., directly output vertices similar to [1*,2*], without intermediate keypoints/road segmentation, as in RNGDet/RNGDet++[3*- this paper is here only for future reference]), it would have been nice to adapt the framework, but no efforts were made.\n\n\n\nReproducibility:\n\nThe code is released in the supplementary material, it should be easy to reproduce the experiments.\n\n___\n[1*]Lazarow, J., Xu, W., & Tu, Z.

The ablation study is worrying to say the least - for an unknown reason, they start with a very poor baseline, despite the focus of the paper being the novel RL graph fixing method. I am waiting for the authors to clarify on this, I hope I haven't understood something right.\n\nThat being said, it proposes an interesting synthetic datasets approach for modelling occlusions/ambiguity. Nevertheless, it is underexploited - not clear why an old road detection was trained on it and how it helps the RL. It was only used in Figure 6 to check that LinkNet (a 5 year old method) is worse? \n",
