            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies the problem of 3D object segmentation and manipulation from images with instance segmentations. It uses NeRF and ask it to further produce an object label per 3D point. They introduce a Hungarian matching based loss to supervise the object label fields with 2D instance segmentations (although that part wasn't clear in the paper). They show better results than the 2D mask-rcnn baseline in terms of 2d segmentation.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- The problem of 3D object segmentation from images is an important problem, and this paper takes an interesting step to solve it.\n- Novelty. The Hungarian matching-based loss seems to be an interesting solution to handle the 2D instance label mismatch during loss evaluation. However, the paper did not provide much detail. For instance, what is the cost function when matching the rendered labels to the ground-truth. When it may fail?\n\nWeakness\n- Clarity. My major concern is on writing and clarity. The method is hard to keep track of, and I don't think readers can easily understand how it work. To improve the writing, the authors may want to improve the figures, use precise notation for losses, and put adequate emphasis on certain parts. See minor comments for more.\n- Experiments. I found the comparison against over-fitted mask-rcnn to be not informative. Assuming the ground-truth segmentation is perfect, mask-rcnn fine-tuned per scene could easily overfit to the ground-truth labels and produce high accuracy. The fact it did not produce high accuracy made me think it is not well-trained. I can only see this experiment to be meaningful if the input segmentation is noisy, and the paper aims to clean it up, while mask-rcnn is not able to do so. \n- Generalization to real data and other setups. The method seemed to be trained on synthetic data with good instance segmentation. If we were to apply it to real world images, we need to answer how sensitive is the method to bad 2D instance segmentations. A related question is how to handle results of existing detectors (for instance Mask-RCNN only gives instance segmentation but not the background and stuff classes). Does it work with panoptic segmentation?\n\nMinor comments\n- Fig 1: object manipulation block is left empty, is this intended?                      \n- Fig 2: losses appeared but not discussed or referred to. Ideally, by looking at the figure, readers would be able to understand the gist of the method.\n- Fig 3: does this corresponds to l-2d-obj? Please make it clear in the caption.\n- Eq 4: $\\delta_k$ is not defined. Is it the same as $d_k$? If $\\delta_k$ is the depth, Eq 4 shouldn\u2019t be called surface distance since it\u2019s measuring the distance to the closest surface along the ray instead of the closest surface in the scene.                                                                                            \n- Eq 5: how does the indicator function work here? If $d-\\Delta d-d_k =0$, value is one?\n- Eq 7: The name of $l_{3d-obj}$ is slightly confusing as it optimizes the emptiness of the object label, but the name indicates it has similar functionality as $l_{2d-obj}$, which optimizes the object label.",

In turn, the near perfect performance of the proposed method on the proposed dataset raises questions regarding the pertinence of the selected scenes to evaluate altogether. Having a more compelling baseline or multiple ones could help the reader accept the proposed contribution at the method level, near perfect. In absence of the aforementioned, it is still difficult to accept as is.\n\n(ii) Object Manipulation: there should be a better justification for a complete lack of a baseline, outside the ablative study as an experimental contribution.\n\n\n(iii) The contributed dataset: the proof of concept applications to validate its usefullness and quality is strongly tied to (i) above, which makes it slightly problematic as it currently stands.\n\n\n- (2) How much does it cost?

As the authors mentioned, many cutting-edge tasks may require obtaining and manipulating individual 3D objects in a 3D scene.\n- The object code supervision proposed by the authors is natural and generates good results. As the authors mentioned, supervising the object code prediction is challenging as the ordering of the objects is not determined. The multiple views of 2D object code with the Hungarian algorithm is a good solution to it (idea originated from 3D-BoNet), and it produces better results than Mask-RCNN.\n- The object manipulator produced reasonable results but has space for improvement. Empirically, the manipulator produced artifacts (Figure 7, first line). At the end of the video \u201cDM-NeRF_2D.mp4\u201d, when the table is being rotated, they are some very unrealistic artifacts as well as unrealistic light.",
