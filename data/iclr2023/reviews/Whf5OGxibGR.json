In particular, the non-stationary behavior is modeled as stationarity conditioned on a set of state variables.  The authors show the identifiability of their model, under the assumption that state variables are observed and there is no instantaneous causal effect. They further propose a VAE-based estimation method to estimate the causal graph, but without a consistency guarantee.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1. This paper considers an interesting and practically useful problem: time-delayed causal discovery from non-stationary data, and models the non-stationary behavior to be stationary conditioned on a set of state variables, which I think is a reasonable assumption.\n\n2. The reported experimental results show that the proposed method has a better performance compared to other methods.\n\n3. The organization and writing are good.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. The authors only give the identifiability results when the state variables are observed (Scenario 1), which is trivial. Because of this, I fail to find significant contributions of this paper.  \n\n2. From Figure 4, it seems the practical performance of the proposed method decreases quickly with increasing variables and state values. \n\n Also, is the proposed method able to handle different time lags?\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a state-dependent causal learning framework for multivariate time series. The goal seems to learn a state-dependent causal graph between multivariate time series. Since causal structures can change dynamically in practice, the targeted task is practically useful if the state is automatically inferred. In this paper, the authors assume that the states are fully observable. Under this setting, the task is to learn a causal graph for each of the K distinct states.\n \nThe authors introduce a VAE-based algorithm to learn the probability of getting an edge between a node pair. The model seems to follow an existing work, but the detail is not clearly given. \n ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- Addresses a general problem of state-dependent causal graph learning.\n- Proposed a generative model to probabilistically learn the causality graph.\n- Conducted empirical evaluation to show a good performance. \n \nWeakness\n- The assumption of being able to observe the state variable sounds very strong. The relative novelty to the existing works might not be very significant.\n- Presentation can be improved. The main probabilistic model is not fully explained. It is not clear how the authors extend the existing work. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "There seem to be significant issues in clarity and novelty.\n \nFor the clarity front, the main probabilistic model that looks interesting is not clearly explained. In particular, I do not understand how GNN was applied. GNN is an approach to learning node embedding vectors, given a graph, which is typically assumed to be an undirected graph. In the present setting, however, the graph is unknown and directed. One possibility could be to iterate between graph estimation and GNN, but no clear-cut explanation is given.\n \nOverall, it is hard to follow the proposed probabilistic causal learning model, and hence, it is hard to figure out what the true novelty is over the existing work. This is really unfortunate because if such an edge-independent Bernoulli-like model works for causal structure learning, it can be a major achievement.\n \nFor the novelty front, the assumption of being able to observe the state itself sounds like a very strong assumption. It is not readily clear to me how it is a significant innovation in light of existing works. Also, the novelty of the proposed probabilistic structure learning model is not very clear to me.\n ",

While being applied to a new problem, it is unclear what difficulties in just combing them. \n\n\nComments:\n-Figure 1 Scenarios: I found these scenarios seems arbitrary set. For example, in S2, s_t only depends on x_t, but in S3, s_t depends on x_t and x_{t-1} (and s_{t-1}). What about any subset of the dependence in Senario 3? Similarly, in S1 and S3, s_t depends on s_{t-1}  but not in S2. These inconsistency should be explained, if there is a specific choice behind it. \n- Stationarity: the description is not totally clear. If one treat the joint distribution as a mixture distribution (with the states being the mixture variables), would it be stationary as well? If not, do you only assume the non-stationarity comes from s? \n- is there a reason why auto-regressive connections are not considered?\n- identiability: it would be good to have a formal statement on this in the paper. In addition, \"at in this hidden state regime the\nprevious theoretical guarantees on identifiability no longer hold due to violations of our assumption\" I'm not sure if the identifiability holds in the proposed VAE structure where you find the lower bounds.
