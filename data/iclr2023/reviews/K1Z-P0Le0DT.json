A new model named RRNADE (Recurrent Real-valued Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator) is proposed for problem-solving. In RRNADE , a recurrent module is used to maintain a set of sufficient statistics for the future state, and a neural net-based mixture of Gaussian module is used to approximate the conditional density function. The authors also prove theoretically that RRNADE is strictly more expressive than the Gaussian hidden Markov model. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets are conducted to show the effectiveness of RRNADE.",

The proposed algorithm is very similar to an existing work, RNADE. Specifically, based on Eqn. (1)~(5), the main difference between RRNADE and RNADE is the usage of the recurrent unit. Additionally, RNN is a popular tool in the online learning literature. I don't think combining the two technologies is innovative enough to meet ICLR's standards.\n\nThe experiment results are somewhat tricky. Specifically, the performance is highly related to the RNN type, which leads to some tricky results. For example, in line \"Cover type\" of Table 1, the usage of \"2RNN\" seems to be necessary, while \"GRU\" appears to be necessary sometimes (line \"Moving RBF\" in Table 2). Doing so is unfair to other baseline algorithms because their structures are fixed rather than carefully tuned by the authors. Meanwhile, the details of how the baseline algorithms are implemented should be written in detail. Another question is how we choose the type of RNN in reality. \n\nThe writing needs to be polished. After reading the first paragraph in the introduction, I feel like I am reading an early-stage draft. For example, the \"he\" should be \"The\", and the punctuation is missing in the last sentence.

It would be better to discuss problems with data stream when using RNADE with a bit more deeper insight rather than stating the 2 reasons provided. Moreover, the reason of number of parameter size going to infinity in RNADE seems like a stretch.\n- Empirical evaluation is not strong enough to show efficacy of the proposed approach. It would be better if more complex datasets are used apart from the benchmark datasets, particularly using image or text datasets as mentioned in the paper's motivation. Furthermore, the competitive approaches used for classification does not seem to be systematically chosen.

It also allows us to tune how adaptive the model is by specifying the window over which the likelihood is maximized.

The proposed method improves on this point.\n- They prove that the proposed model is strictly more expressive than Gaussian HMMs.\n\n# Weaknesses\n- The proposed method has several hyper-parameters that are not systematically selected in the experiments.\n- The proposed method introduces an additional complexity the existing model by introducing a flexible recurrent module.\n- The main contribution of the work is not clear to me from the paper. It seems RNADE can be almost directly applicable to the online setup. The difference I can see from RNADE is removing the limitation of the recurrent module being additive and allow it to be any function (the first eq. of Eqs. (3)). But the paper does not provide enough evidence showing that the modification is really worth the complication.\n- The problem setup is not mathematically defined. It is not clear what distribution drift or what evaluation metric the paper considers. Without defining those, I don't think we can even discuss the learnability issue. They use terms such as \"abrupt concept drift\" or \"smooth drift\", but they are not clearly defined.\n- The paper does not explain how and how much the update (line (7) and (12) of Algorithm 1) is performed. For example, the learning rate should matter in online learning.",

(5).\n- In page 5, \"the first observation $x_1$ is discarded but $h_1$ still represents sufficient statistics of all past observations, including $x_1$\": is this an assumption?\n- It was not clear how we model the density without the density module in ND and NRND.",

The method is simple, clear, and brings some practical improvements. The model section is easy to follow.\n\nCons:\n\n- Related works: I feel that the related work section could be more detailed. The authors mention continual and increamental leanring as related problems but these are not discussed in the related work. It might also be interesting to discuss the related works around other density estimation methods (e.g. Normalizing Flows). Further the concept of drift could also be more detailed. E.g. (Generalized Out-of-Distribution Detection, Yang et al) makes the distinction between sensory/covariate and semantic shifts. Action suggestion: Enrich the related work wth some discussion on continual learning, density estimation methods, and shift types.\n- Mathematical notation: I was confused with the not bold x notation in formula (1), (2) vs the bold x notation in defintion 1. What are the difference between these two notations ? I was also confused with the argument of f_R in the definition 1 which looks like a multiplication of all x_1, x_2, \u2026 and x_n. Should it be f_R(x_1, x_2, x_n). Action suggestion: Fix and clarify the mathematical notations.\n- Experiences:\n    - The importance of the hyper-parameters l and p is not clear. It would be interesting to have one experiment where these hyper-parameter are changing. It allows practionners to know what is the impact of these introduced hyper-parameters. Action suggestion: Make an experiment when l and p vary.\n    - I had the feeling that the test in Fig. 2 text was very small and not easy to read withou important zooming. Action suggestion: Make the text bigger.\n    - The experiments on density estimation focus on only on synthetic toy datasets. While these experiments are interesting since they provide the ground-truth, I feel that it is important to test also on real-datasets. Further, it would also be important to compare to other methods. Currently results only show RRNADE results on Fig. 2. Action suggestion: add real-dataset and other baselines in the density estimation experiments.\n    - For completeness, it would be nice to have details on the used datasets in the paper or appendix. Further, these datasets look fairly small datasets and require only very simple input encoder. E.g. RNADE paper look also at image and maybe speech datasets. Action suggestion: consider larger datasets with more complex input encoder.\n    - Since RRNADE is an extension of RNADE, it would be interesting to have some comparison of the two methods in the experiments to show that RRNADE fixes practical limits of RNADE (e.g. number of parameters). Action suggestion: Make a comparison of RRNADE and RNADE.\n    - \u201cThe results of these methods are obtained from the corresponding papers.\u201d: It sounds that the the baselines results are simply copy-pasted from the previous papers. I feel that this is generally a bad practice. For a precised evaluation, methods should be implemented using the same framework and use the same evaluation pipeline. In partciular, it is imposible to know how ISVM and LASVM perform compare to RRNADE on four datasets. Further, the baselines do not have error bars. Action suggestion: Ideally, run each baseline on each datasets and get error bars. If this is too difficult in the available time, I would expect the repoduction of at least the two strongest baselines and complete the N/A missing numbers.\n\nOthers:\n\n- Typo: \u201c**T**he problem\u201d first paragraph on p.1\n- Typo: \u201cconstrain**t**s\u201d second paragraph on p.1\n- Cite RNADE paper  when introducing it on p.1\n\nI am happy to improve my score if a majority of the above points are addresses (e.g. with the action suggestions).",

To account for the drift in data distribution, the model is updated with the likelihood of recent samples rather than the entire history that may be available in memory.\n\nRRNADE is extended to predict class labels by learning class conditional density models, and prediction is made with the Bayes rule. \n\nThe authors demonstrate the superiority of their method theoretically by showing that RRNADE is more powerful than gaussian HMM and empirically by evaluating on a synthetic dataset for density estimation and several real-world binary classification tasks.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- This paper addresses an important problem of learning from streaming data, and the proposed method is shown to outperform several baselines. \n- The method is easier to understand and simple to follow. However, some parts are unclear, and the writing could be much better (see weakness)\n\nWeaknesses: \n- A description of baselines needs to be included; only pointers to previous papers that use these baselines are provided. Authors should make the papers as self-contained as possible. \n- Another problem is that most baselines use non-deep learning methods. Authors do not compare/cite deep learning methods for online learning, such as [1,2]. How does your method compare to these?\n- The complexity of tasks is unclear. Mainly authors have not provided any description (e.g., # features, # samples, what is being predicted, etc.) of the datasets, which makes it harder to judge the complexity of tasks. \n- Theoretically, RRNADE can solve multi-class classification problems. However, it is only empirically evaluated on binary classification tasks. Would we see similar empirical improvements on multi-class problems?\n\n\n[1] Online Deep Learning: Learning Deep Neural Networks on the Fly, Sahoo, et al., IJCAI 2018 https://openreview.net/forum?id=SyWKcXMOWH \n[2] Adaptive online incremental learning for evolving data streams, Zhang, et al., Applied Soft Computing 105 (2021) https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01633\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- As mentioned in the weakness, the paper lacks details about baselines and datasets. Please try to make the work self-contained and provide brief descriptions, even if in the appendix. \n- Some reproducibility details are missing: e.g., the learning rates used to train the models or the hyperparameter configurations with which results are reported (obtained after validation). \n- The paper can be made clear at various points: \n\t- Features in NADE vs. Samples in RRNADE: It was not clear to me until sec 3.1, where the problem about infinite length stream is mentioned, that here we are modeling samples in an autoregressive fashion instead of features (as done in the original NADE work). It could be clarified earlier. \n\t - From the text, it seems only \\xeta_c and R are updated when encountering a sample with label C. However that is not the case (Alg 1, line 12). The authors could use cross-entropy loss due to the uniform prior assumption, and that makes sense too, but these should be clarified in the text.  \n\t - Fig 1., some subscripts are wrong. E.g.,  p(x_{1+3}|x_{[l,l+2]}) -> p(x_{n-1+3}|x_{[n-l,n-l+2]})   \n\n\nMinor: \n- Fig 2: Please use consistent markers between the bottom and top rows. \n- Fig 3: Please use the appropriate size for the table and figures.\n- There are typos and grammatical errors. Proofread and correct these.

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the proposed method is interesting and relevant. However, many experimental details are missing. Moreover, some important neural network-based baselines are missing. Therefore, I am leaning towards rejecting a paper and would suggest revising the paper. I am willing to increase the score if the authors address the missing baselines and update the manuscript with experimental details.",
