In Table 3, is there any reason why the LayersNet is not trained and tested with inner garments only as well? Otherwise, I think DeePSD for inner garments only is not needed either.\n3. Does the wind velocity affect the accuracy of the model? How well does the model perform with different wind speeds? In the simulation, very minor differences in the initial setting can cause significantly different end results (i.e., known as instability of the simulation). Does that happen as well for the model? If so, is there any particular way to overcome this so that the prediction errors can make more sense? Please add some discussions regarding this topic.\n4.

Can the author clarify the differences between the approaches.\n\n- In eq. 3 the garment is modelled as a function of body and previous state of the garment. Since the paper primarily deals with multi-layered garments, should't the garment also be a function of other garments on the body?\neg: let's say a person is wearing a loose skirt and a long jacket on top, such that the bottom of the jacket draper around the top of the skirt. Isn't the jacket deformation more dependent on the skirt than the body?\n\n- Eq. 14 only handles collisions between the body and the garments, but since authors deal with multi-layered garments, what about the collisions between different layers of garments?\n\n- Related work on multi-layered garment is completely missing. This important as multi-layered garments are the main contribution of the work. Authors should add a paragraph about it as currently it appears that the authors are the first one to address multi-layered garments which is not true.\n--> SMPLicit, CVPR'21 (not cited) has shown generation of multi-layered garments.\n--> SimulCap, CVPR'19 (not cited) Also use multi-layered garments + physics based simulation for motion capture.\n--> Another concurrent work: Layered-Garment Net, ACCV'22 (not cited) also generates multi-layered clothing using simulated data.\n\nClarifications:\n- Eq. 12: Shouldn't this be a double summation. One over multi-layered garments and other over vertices of the garment.\n- What is f(.) in the line just above eq. 3?\n- There are existing works like TailorNet, Patel et al. 2021 that also use PBS to drape garments on human body. Can the authors also provide details on how simulating multiple layers is more challenging than simulating single layered clothing?\n",

It is not clear to me how is the existing garment modelling different than the particle based modelling in TIE, Shao 2020. Moreover, parts of the formulation seem to be tailored for modelling single layered garments and not multiple layers. eg: intersection is handled only with the body and garment and not garment-garment.\n\nCan the authors also provide video results from their method. This is important as the authors deal with garment simulation over time and we should see the quality of the simulated data (the proposed dataset) as well as the results from LayersNet.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "MULTI-LAYERED 3D GARMENTS ANIMATION\n\nThis paper presents a novel deep learning-based 3D garments animation method. The method learns to model interactions between 1) cloth-body, 2) multiple cloth layers 3) wind and clothes. Specifically, the algorithm decomposes the clothes into connected patches and evaluates the deformation based on a learning-based particle physics simulator (Shao et al., 2022). A new simulation dataset has been proposed to study this new setting. \n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros: \n- The new capacity for learning-based clothes simulation to handle both wind-cloth, body-cloth, and inter-cloth interactions. \n- Superior performance compared against DeePSD through a thoughtful exp design. \n- The paper is clearly presented. Equations/tables/figures are all easy to parse. The intro is clear. Related covers most of the relevant works.\n- New large-scale dataset with realistic simulation and unique designs (e.g., wind). \n\nCons:\n- The problem setting of data-driven animation here is not well-motivated. \n- The comparison study is somewhat limited. \n- Lack of qualitative demonstrations and comparisons. \n\nMixed:\n- Technical contribution. The paper belongs to a novel application / resemble of existing techniques (1. data-driven particle-based simulation from Shao et al. and 2. patch-based garments representation used in Ma et al. and earlier works. e.g., Kavan et al. Siggraph 11, Feng et al. 2010)\n- The above two core contributions the author claimed to differentiate the proposed work from prior works are not entirely original. That said, I still appreciate the novel ensemble and applications to data-driven simulation under the wind. \n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The data-driven motivation is not particularly clear to me. \n- In this work, the proposed method learns to mimic a physical simulator\u2019s behavior. The author needs to justify its use cases, i.e., \u201cwhy data-driven method?\u201d Given that we have options for physical-based clothes animation solutions, I expect the author to discuss when and why data-driven is beneficial. \n- I think the author can answer the question at least from one of the three aspects: 1) the data-driven method is faster than the Blender\u2019s simulator; 2) the data-driven simulator is better than a real-time physical-based simulator (e.g., 3) data-driven simulator can offer other capacities (e.g., system identification, where end-to-end differentiability allows inferring physical params through inverse problem solver; or sim2real, where the learned particle-dynamic model can be applied for real-world data). \n- However, I cannot find a runtime report or comparison against a real-time garment simulator or a demonstration of downstream demonstrations. \n\nDataset details:\n- It\u2019s also unclear how fast Blender\u2019s clothes simulation is and what method they use (it is also particle based?). \n- Training/testing splits -- during testing how many samples are from unseen poses / unseen human shapes/ unseen clothes materials? \n\nOverall the comparison experiments are not entirely thorough. \n- First, it should be compared against a differentiable particle-based physical solver, if possible, such as DiffCloth, or a real-time physical solver for a speed-performance trade-off. \n- Another data-driven method, SCALE (Ma et al.), should also be compared. SCALE might not be directly modeling wind. But the author can also add wind as an additional attribute, similar to what the author did for DeePSD. \n- Besides, the paper also lacks qualitative comparison against DeePSD. It seems the performance gap is quite large quantitatively, but I would also like to know how it works visually compared to DeePSD. \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall I am on the fence. I would like to see how the author addresses my aforementioned concerns and questions. \n\n\n----------------------------------------------\nPost-rebuttal. \n\nThe authors addressed most concerns by providing additional experiments and revised the submission accordingly. \n\nOverall, it is a weak-accept to borderline-ish submission. \n\nThe paper presentation is quite clear, and the technical approach is straightforward, as pointed out by both the authors and reviewers -- fusing particle simulation in TIE (Shao et al.) with patch-based representation in SCALE (Ma et al.) for efficiency. The method achieves the SOTA in runtime and speed and can handle external force and unseen clothes types.  \n\nIt is a well-executed and well-presented paper after the revision. The proposed combination is somewhat new and, indeed, solves practical challenges of prior arts (efficiency, external force, and multi-layer interaction). It's not a ground-breaking or surprising idea, but it sets a new state for the field and brings new capacity. Hence it doesn't harm to get accepted for its practicality. ",
