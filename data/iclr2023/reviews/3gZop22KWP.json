            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a systematic study on several design choices for pure clip guided text to 3D NeRF generation. It shows how different image augmentations improves the results. Different CLIP architectures are compared and it is observed that the ensemble of CLIP models performs better. Authors also show that implicit grid model parameterized by MLPs perform better than explicit grid. Additionally, this work introduces a spherical prior that facilitate training in this task. The final model achieves satisfactory grid synthesis using CLIP guidance only, which outperforms previous methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n- This paper presents a systematic study on several design choices for pure clip guided text to 3D NeRF generation, which has not been done before.  In general, the study summarizes several techniques that would stabilize training and prevent adversarial results. The experimental results would serve as a useful guidance in related tasks.\n\n- Combining several designs, the final model achieves impressive 3D grid synthesis using CLIP guidance only. Compared to DreamField, it achieves more coherent results with higher memory efficiency and faster training speed.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- As a work aiming for \"systematic study\", the quantitative study is weak. Quantitative results are only provided for the final models but not for ablation study. It is unclear how consistent is the ablation study as only a few qualitative examples are provided. Thus, I suggest also providing quantitative results for the ablation studies on data augmentations and backbones.\n\n- The design choices studied in the paper (different augmentations, backbones, voxel grids) are simply some common techniques that exist before and there is not much new techniques in the paper. The results are also not surprising, as it is intuitive that augmentations, model ensemble, and implicit fields can improve results.\n\n- (Minor) For the implicit model, it is not explained why it is used to model only grid coordinates instead of continuous coordinates like NeRF. My guess is that this is more efficient, but it's better to mention it.\n\n- Typo:  \nPage 5 line 7: ',' -> '.'  \nSection 6 line 7: 'effect' -> 'affect'",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is clearly written. Implementation details, running speed, and memory cost are provided in Appendix. Thus I think it is reproducible. The 3D synthesis results obtained in this work is very promising. The qualitative examples shown are significantly better than prior works. However, the novelty is limited as this work mainly focus on a thorough study of several design choices.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper, by studying a number of design factors, finds a good setting that achieves impressive 3D object synthesis from CLIP guidance only. The performance is much better than previous methods. However, the technical novelty is somewhat limited and the quantitative study is weak. Considering the impressive results and that this work focus on a systematic study, the novelty is not a big issue and I am inclined to accept this paper. But I suggest adding more quantitative evaluation to make the results more solid.",

However, in this case, I found the studied a fairly narrow topic - only text-to-3D with CLIP and only on a few aspects like augmentation, CLIP architecture. I think there are many other aspects the authors might consider: synthesizing meshes as included in the related work, other feature encodings like instant-ngp.

The only thing I am skeptical is the technique contributions and overall contribution to the research community. Therefore, currently I think currently it is below the acceptance threshold. But if the authors provides more clarification on my questions, I am willing to discuss and change my rating.",
