Eventually, integrate over all the circles. \n\nThe authors show that this construction defines a pseudo-metric on $P(S^{d-1})$ (probability measures supported on the hypersphere) ; provide implementation details and showcase their approach in a variety of experiments.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strengths : \n- The paper is overall very well written, with appropriate level of mathematical rigor (though this may be a matter of taste). \n- The construction is very natural yet (perhaps surprisingly) new to the best of my knowledge. \n- While I did not proofread the appendices in full details, proofs seems well-written and I did not identify a major flaw at first glance. \n- [minor but still] The figures are of high-quality. \n\n# Weaknesses : \n- (1) To some extend, one may argue that the contributions of the work are somewhat limited, in sense that the construction follows the exact step of the usual SW distance and, up to few technical modification brought to the Radon transform, there is no specific \"breakthrough\" in this paper. \n- (2) The setting is restricted to the spherical case. While this yield elegant formulas and possible implementation overall, it is also somewhat disappointing in sense that the proposed method may be generalized quite well (typically intersecting [insert assumptions here] hypersurfaces with $V_{d,2}$). From a theoretical standpoint, that may lead to a more instructive construction. \n- (3) A reference and discussion to the recent preprint _Intrinsic sliced wasserstein distances for comparing collections of probability distributions on manifolds and graphs_, Rustamov et al., may be relevant. In this work as well, the authors build a SW-like distance on manifolds. They follow a fairly different approach though (relying on the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the manifold). It is not clear to me how the two methods compare. While the approach proposed in the current paper seems (to me) more natural and easier to implement, the one of Rustamov et al., has the benefits of being more general and quite original. ",

I overall think that the novelty is somewhat limited. See **Weaknesses** above. \n\n# Reproducibility \n\nThe clarity of the paper makes the work reasonably easy to reproduce as far as I can tell. \nSome experimental details in the **Runtime Comparison** paragraph are lacking though. Saying that SSW is faster (or not) than Sinkhorn is not very inisghtful given that these algorithms compute different things. Sinkhorn approximates the true Wasserstein distance while \"Monte-Carlo SSW\" approximate the true SSW which, as far as I can tell, is not directly related to the true Wasserstein distance between the two measures.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper introduces Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein (SSW) as a \"pseudometric\" to measure the dissimilarity between distributions defined on a hypersphere. At its core, the paper utilizes the prior work proposed by Rabin et al. 2011a that studies transport-based distances on circles and proposes efficient numerical schemes for calculating these distances. The authors then propose to slice distributions defined on a hypersphere by projecting them onto the great circles leading to spherical slices. Lastly, following the vanilla-sliced Wasserstein framework, the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein is defined as the expected Wasserstein distance between the spherical slices of two distributions. According to Rabin et al. 2011a, the 1-Wasserstein distance between two distributions defined on a circle has a closed-form solution and can be obtained efficiently.  In addition, the authors show that the 2-Wasserstein distance between a distribution defined on a circle and the uniform distribution also has a closed-form and computationally efficient solution (Proposition 1). \n\nThe paper provides extensive experiments (both in the main paper and in the appendix) showing that the proposed SSW \"pseudometric\" is effective in various applications, from density estimation to gradient flow and learning auto-encoders. The appendix also provides additional results on, for instance, self-supervised learning with spherical latent representations. The results indicate the robustness and effectiveness the proposed dissimilarity measure. ",

What I particularly appreciate is that while some of the experiments are not large-scale, they remain challenging to solve by existing methods. \n\n### Weaknesses\n\nI don't see any significant weaknesses in this paper. Below are not necessarily weaknesses but points that could improve the paper. \n\n* It would have been great if the authors could show that the proposed Radon transform is invertible, and hence SSW is indeed a metric as opposed to a pseudometric. \n* I am surprised that SW distance works so well compared to SSW for spherical distributions. I was expecting a more significant performance gap. \n\n ",

In addition, the code was provided by the authors, and I found the results easily reproducible. ",

That projection acts as the projection on straight line used in Sliced Wasserstein (SW). Overall the projection operators are formulated as matrices over Stiefel manifold. Using known results on Wasserstein distance on circle, a sliced version of Wasserstein distance on sphere is derived.\n- As a contribution, the paper proposes a closed-form projection of the training samples from the sphere to the great circle using matrix on Stiefel manifold.\n- Another interesting contribution is the proposal of the spherical Radon transform and related dual operator that allow to rephrase SSW as a function of the new Radon transform.  The pseudo-distance property of SSW is established in Proposition 4.\n- Intensive empirical evaluations are conducted. They show that SSW exhibit a favorable runtime in a large scale setting. Used as a loss function, SSW allows for density estimation of simulated and real datasets with advantageous empirical results. Also SSW proves effective in generative modeling applied to classical Mnist, Fashion Mnist and Cifar datasets.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n- The plain metric property of SSW is not guaranteed.\n- Topological properties of SSW compared to plain Wasserstein distance on sphere are not discussed. Can one theoretically or empirically relate SSW to its plain counterpart?\n- For readability purpose, it would be interesting to formally introduce the notion of great circle in the paper. \n\n*Minor comments*\n\n- In Figure 4 illustration, which dataset is shown?\n- On page 8, the sentence \"We see on this figure that the normalizing flows fitted are able to recover the principles modes of the data\" is not clear. Where exactly on Figure 5 the recovery of the modes are highlighted?\n- The paper should better introduce (at least in the supplementary material) some preliminary notions of Wasserstein distance on the circle. Especially, the parametrization by the interval [0, 1[ on the real line should be better explained.\n- Some notations or abbreviations have to be clarified or formally defined within the main text. For instance, in equation (6), $C(\\mathbb{R} \\times S^{d-1})$ is not stated. Page 4, what $\\mathcal{P}_{p, ac}$ stands for? Page 9, NF is for normalizing flows?",
