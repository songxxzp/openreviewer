            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper develops an arbitrary virtual try on network by preserving characteristics representation and trade-off between body and clothes. In general, this work is an 2d virtual try-on task, which aims to handle three challengeable issues in GAN based try-on task. How to solve cross-category try-on task, how to well warp the targeted clothes according to the pose and body of targeted human, and how to merge the clothes and body information into the final try-on figures.  After careful reading, the main contributions of the proposed work can be summarized as follows: 1) to develop a new framework with three stages for well solving the above challengeable problems. In detail, the LPM mod\tule is to predict the exposed limbs when long pants are changed to short pants, which tends to be confronted in cross-category try-on task; 2) the IGM module is to designed to warp clothes according to the targeted person based on the locally linear information; 3) trade-off fusion module is to fusion the targeted body and targeted clothes information into final virtual try-on performance by replacing artifact parts. All the three module is targeted and practical. The simulation results including ablation study and comparison work based on new collected dataset are also convincing to verify the effectiveness of the proposed work.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The work is easy to understand and well structured.\n2. The novelties of the work are sufficient. The work has developed three modules in the try-on network framework, which are targeted to solve the problems confronted in GAN based 2D virtual try-on task. Specifically, the LPM module is the most important novelty developed in the proposed work. It is to predict the exposed or hidden limbs when perform cross-category try-on task, i.e., long pants<->short pants, this can be the first work pointed out, through which the arbitrary virtual try-on can be realized. \n3. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed work both in regular paper and appendix parts. The ablation study and compared work show the superiority of the proposed method.\n4. The authors have also collected a new dataset with more categories to train the network for cross-category and arbitrary-category try-on tasks. Based on the dataset, more types of simulations have been conducted to further analyze the proposed method, including arbitrary clothing collocation, user study, qualified analysis on LPM and IGMM.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The final conclusion is not well written. Some future work can be involved to show how the proposed work can handle real-world application, instead of just writing some sentences from introduction or abstract.\n2. The structure of each module can be more detailed. If possible, such structure can be illustrated in the appendix. In addition, some data processing strategy should also be provided.\n3. How to get ground truth $c_r$ and $l_r$. Does it need additional annotation? I suggest the authors can explain this point.\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a method to handle arbitrary clothing in Virtual try on models. The papers argue that recent approaches in virtual try-on lack coverage in cases where the clothing styles change vastly, for example from skirt to pants or long sleeve to short sleeves. To cover such cases they proposed a limb prediction module which takes as input human and target clothing representations and produces the exposed limbs. \nSecondly, to cover the clothing deformation better, in their geometric deformation module, they modified previously used Thin-Plate Splines (TPS), by replacing TPS RBF functions with the Phi function of Wendland Wendland. The module takes as input human representations from the Limb prediction module, in addition to clothing and human representations and produces deformed clothing.\n\nFinally, in their Trade-off fusion module (TOFM) they adopt a GAN-based method which uses a pair of UNet as a generator and a multi-scale discriminator D as in pix2pixHD.  The authors argue that to preserve the details of clothing and body parts in the final render image, they use the wrapped clothed features from the geometric deformation module and refined human features ( from LPM) are fused by element-wise sum and concatenated with warped clothed features and human representation features to predict mask and rendered person. \n\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \nThe paper is well written,  is  easy to read and follow, and the descriptions of each module is clear .\n\nThe model is evaluated on two different dataset, and it shows improvement compared to VTON, CPVTON, and VTNF.  While showing marginal improvement to ACGPN approach which uses similar ideas as described in this paper. \n\nTheir LPM uses a new input type, that represents the person's body better, and does not include clothing items in it, resulting in better final output. \n\nWeakness: \nThe paper related works are outdated and did not cover several important works which have been done in 2021. For example it would have been good to compare their approach specifically with :\n\n1- VITON-HD: High-Resolution Virtual Try-On via Misalignment-Aware Normalization, Choi, Seunghwan and Park, Sunghyun and Lee, Minsoo and Choo, Jaegul, CVPR 2021, \n\n2- Parser-Free Virtual Try-on via Distilling Appearance Flows, CVPR 2021\n\n3- Dressing in the Wild by Watching Dance Videos, CVPR2022\n\n4- High-Resolution Virtual Try-On with Misalignment and Occlusion-Handled Conditions, Lee, Sangyun and Gu, Gyojung and Park, Sunghyun and Choi, Seunghwan and Choo, Jaegul, ECCV2022\n\nMost of the  work that has been done during the last year covers the same issues raised in this paper and achieved superior results compared to this paper.  For example in 5- ZFlow: Gated Appearance Flow-based Virtual Try-on with 3D Priors, ICCV2021, uses similar representations as input to their model as in LPM.\n\n\nIt is not clear how the segmentation of the body parts(p) in LPM are generated. The reference to the section is missing. I guess the paper has a missing section explaining how the masks are generated?\n\nnot sure if their collected dataset from zalando is also anything new as similar dataset was used in VITON-HD: High-Resolution Virtual Try-On via Misalignment-Aware Normalization\n\nCan the model generate a person in pants when only the upper part of the person is given as input?\nIt would be also good to see the result of the model on diverse clothing, for example a person in tight fitting clothing to a loose dress.\n\nIn figure 6 it would be good to compare their cloth deformation module with the work in ACGPN.\n\nIt is preferable to report the results with generated image resolution in the tables for better comparisons across different works. \n\n\n",
