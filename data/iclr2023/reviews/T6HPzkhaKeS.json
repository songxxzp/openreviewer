The contributions are as follows:\n\n1. Action Matching relies only on samples and does not require any knowledge of the underlying stochastic dynamics by learning only the dynamics, which is based on a mathematically well-defined formulation and useful when a complicated distribution has simple dynamics. \n2. They discussed Action Matching as a variational framework for learning these dynamics\n3. For applications of Action Matching, they performed computer vision tasks with several stochastic equations such as generative modeling, super-resolution, colorization, and inpainting. \n\n",

Is this correct? Are there any other dynamics than you analyzed? \n* Fig. 3: what are the two types of pictures for Score/Action matching?\n* Fig. 4: If they are generated, the information of input and the dynamics may be necessary for understanding.

In particular, this technique falls along the lines of score-based / diffusion probabilistic models, by learning about the 'derivative' of the probability distribution rather than directly modeling the density.\n\nThe paper claims that the main difference between action matching and score matching is that action matching learns about the derivative along the time axis. The argument is that a distribution can be complicated to model for each time slice, but actually has very little change w.r.t. time, so modeling this change w.r.t. time can make the learning problem easier.",
