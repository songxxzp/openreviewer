The proposed algorithm dynamically adjusts weights between supervised loss and self-supervised consistency loss during model training. The weights are adjusted by the values of loss terms on-the-fly. And the self-supervised loss is based on different augmentations on the same images, and introduced as weighted augmentation consistency (WAC) regularization. Moreover, the experimental results validate the proposed algorithm on two public 3D medical image segmentation datasets. Both fully- and partially-labeled scenarios are studied in the experiments.",
