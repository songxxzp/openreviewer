            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors study the problem of long-tailed visual recognition. For this end, they propose a new sampling strategy from the perspective of \"effective samples\" proposed earlier by Cui et al. (2019).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n- Effective number of samples is a promising idea to explore for sampling.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The paper is extremely difficult to read, making it infeasible to comprehend its contributions, its line of reasoning, its methodology, its overlaps / differences to prior work etc.\n\n1.1 The paper has too many grammatical errors, some which are listed below for the first page. I gave up providing recommendations for the rest of the paper. I strongly suggest the authors to submit only polished, proof-read papers to venues, especially top ones such as ICLR. In its current state, the papers feels like it has been rushed and it might be containing different types of errors, not only grammatical ones.\n\n1.2. Many unclear parts or statements, e.g. (only for the first one/two pages): \n\n- \"inconsistent difficulty of data collection from source\" => It is not clear what's meant by inconsistent difficulty.\n- \"For example of the data collection on the cat category, the total samples of hairless cats Probably much smaller than any hairy type\" => This is Probably not a convincing statement.\n- \"multiple repeated sampling from the same source for different angles\" => What is an angle here?\n\n- It is not clear how the formulations in Section 3.1.1 are derived.\n\n- Table 1, 2: It is not clear what the imbalance ratios are.\n\n2. I find it too strong to call an approach a theory. \n\n3. Section 2 is missing approaches using regularization or normalization as a form of regularization, e.g. \"Long-Tailed Recognition via Weight Balancing\", CVPR2022. The paper also missed earlier work focusing on the design of sampling approaches: \"Assessing the Effect of Training Sampling Design on the Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers for Land Cover Mapping Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data and Google Earth Engine\", 2021.\n\n4. Another important limitation is about evaluation. The paper provides a mixed comparison in Tables 1 & 2, without discussing explicitly the contribution over existing sampling approaches. The paper should dedicate a separate section & analysis for a comparison with existing sampling approaches.\n\n5. The paper provides a SOTA comparison only on CIFAR10 & CIFAR100. Results on more challenging datasets such as ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist are necessary to see how the method fairs in challenging settings.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- \"This phenomena dose not only occurs in image classification\" => \"This phenomena dose not only occur in image classification\".\n- \"semantic segmentation He et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2020a)\" => I think the correct cite command is \\citep. The correct form should have been: \"semantic segmentation (He et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a)\". Similar problems exist in the rest of the paper.\n- \"Kang et al. (2019); Zhou et al. (2020) mentions\" => \"Kang et al. (2019); Zhou et al. (2020) mention\".\n- \"two stages learning\" => \"two-stage learning\".\n- \"Sampling process need be conducted\" => \"Sampling process needs be conducted\".\n- \"*\" means multiplication in a programming language. You should use \\cdot or \\times.\n- Please follow the following guide for writing equations: http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.899/papers/mermin.pdf\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on classification problems for long-tailed image datasets. Specifically, the authors first establish an effective sampling theory to theoretical study the total number of effective samples and effective sample utilization in sampling with/without replacement. Then two general jitter sampling strategies are proposed for increasing the actual training effect in sampling with replacement. Finally, the experiments on three long-tailed datasets for many baselines indicate the classification performance of the proposed methods.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper focuses on a fundamental and valuable problem, the long-tail problem on real-world datasets. As one of the solutions to the long-tailed classification problem, it is significant to study re-sampling, especially the theoretical analysis of sampling strategies on long-tailed distributions.\nSeveral experiments are carried out on three real-world image datasets. The classification performances of the three proposed methods are evaluated by comparing them with thirteen baseline methods (both single-expert and multi-expert). In addition, the authors conduct ablation studies to highlight the importance of each component in the proposed methods.\nHowever, my main concern is that the novelty and significance of the new theory are not well stated and that the experimental results do not support the contributions well. Here are the detailed comments:\n[Presentation] First of all, the writing of the paper is not easy to follow for two reasons. (1) There are many statements and claims without clear meanings. For example, the meaning of the actual sampling frequency may need to explain when first mentioned. (2) Some notations are not clearly defined or have been used before the definition. For example, the definition of the subscript \"m\" is not given or is written in an inconspicuous place.\n[Novelty] I think the proposed new theory is not innovative enough compared to the existing conclusions (Kang et al., Cui et al.), and it does not bring a conceptual breakthrough. According to the statements in the paper, I cannot understand what and how the new theory improves the existing theories on which it is based. Currently in my opinion, it simply expresses an intuitive conclusion in mathematical terminology and may not bring a few new perspectives on how to design sampling methods in the future.\n[Method Details] Method 1 and Method 2 lack important details. I cannot find any description of the parameter settings. For example, what do \\alpha, \\beta, and \\gamma represent? Are they learnable, or are they hyperparameters? These are critical parts of the methods, and the lack of information hampers my understanding of how the methods work.\n[Experiments] In the experimental results of image classification, the methods proposed by the paper show equivalent or even reduced performances to some of the other alternative methods. Based on such experimental results, contributions compared to previous work cannot be significantly proved. In addition, some parts of the manuscript (abstract, conclusion) seem to overstate the performance and should be reformulated. \n",
