            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new method for bi-temporal images classification based on Siamese variational autoencoder (VAE) and transfer learning (TL). First, the suggested generative method utilizes two VAEs to extract features from bi-temporal images. Then, the obtained features are concatenated into a feature vector. To get a classification map of the source scene, the classifier receives the concatenated vector and the ground truth data as input. The source model is fine-tuned to be applied to the target scene with less ground truth data using a TL strategy.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: The proposed method is reasonable and feasible.\nWeaknesses: However, the novelty of this work is limited. Siamese networks and VAE are common techniques for many applications. The authors only combine them simply to deal with their tasks. I cannot any innovative ideas in the current manuscript. Also, the testing data are remote sensing (RS) images. Nevertheless, the proposed method looks like a general-purpose model. Do the author sure that their method is suitable for RS images?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "1. The writing and organization of this manuscript should be improved carefully. The current version does not highlight important issues for the readers. For example, the reasons for the selection of VAE, and the suitable application scenario of your method. Besides, all figures should be replaced by high-definition versions. \n2. I do not think the readers can find valuable information in Introduction and Related Work.\n2. The contents related to the proposed method are basic knowledge of VAE and TL. What are your contributions?\n3. Experimental settings are blurry, which prevents the readers from simulating your method. It is unacceptable.\n4. Experiments are not convincing. The testing data is deficient, compared methods are insufficient, and the results are discussed as shallow. \n5. What specific characteristics of the testing data do you consider?\n",

The model receives as input to scenes of the same spatial location but collected during different times. The SVAE is optimized using a crossentropy classification loss computed using an image classifier on top of the concatanation of the latent representations of the two input images in addition to  standard reconstruction losses. The model was evaluated for the task of desertification detection using Sentinel 2 imagery in South Tunisia. The model shows better performance than siamese convolutional neural networks for this task.",
