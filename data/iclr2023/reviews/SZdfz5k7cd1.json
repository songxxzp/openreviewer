The proposed TB characterizes the decision-distribution interplay with latent causal factors. Given some specific data dynamics, the authors proved that one cannot directly achieve the long-term fairness goal through a single-step decision. This further motivates them to develop a sequence of algorithmic interventions to get closer to the long-term fairness goal. Their method has been examined by both synthetic and real data.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper is about defining long-term fairness in dynamic settings and characterizing whether it can be achieved with myopic decisions. A specific dynamic model is proposed, where tiers (representing social status) are a root cause of labels (representing social outcomes), and which in turn can be affected by decisions (representing social interventions). Another root cause influencing decisions are the protected attributes (representing historically underserved groups). Long-term fairness is defined as independence of tiers from protected attributes (representing a form of social equality), achieved over some time horizon. This is dubbed tier-balancing. Under several assumptions, the paper determines that (1) such fairness is not generally achievable over a single time step horizon, that (2) a perfect decision (mirroring the true label) worsens fairness, and that (3) counterfactually fair decisions could improve fairness.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths\n\n* Long-term fairness is a very strongly motivated problem and various perspectives on characterizing and achieving it are welcome.\n* Connecting causal and dynamic models in this framework is natural, and the paper\u2019s model has some compelling features that could reflect many practical instances.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* The paper claims that the concept of tier balancing as the implicit long-term fairness objective is novel. However, many of the initial long-term fairness papers encoded similar social equality notions, e.g., the Mouzannar et al 2019 reference, where qualifications are equalized across protected groups.\n* The dynamic model that is adopted has some key social implications which are not discussed. Namely, social mobility (tiers shifting) is influenced only by social outcomes and interventions. This is markedly false in real life, where prejudices and privileges dictated by protected groups affect mobility. Unfortunately, this is not a simple fix for this paper, since the introduction of any such dependence would severely change its analysis and conclusions.\n* The dynamic model of the evolution of tiers, Eq. (3), is also too specific. In particular, I put in question the choice of a deterministic evolution, given labels and decisions. The entirety of the analysis hinges on this, as it determines exactly relationships between consecutive time steps, as enumerated case-by-case in the appendix tables. It is not clear how well the conclusions drawn from this determinism would apply to a more realistic stochastic model of social mobility. (A more specific nitpick I have is why mobility is influenced by non-instantiated labels, that is, why depend on $Y^{\\textrm{(ori)}}$ and not on $Y^{\\textrm{(obs)}}$? What I did not exhibit should not affect me.)\n* The technical exposition is generally disorganized and may have some flaws. I had to go back and forth between the main text and appendices to piece together the mathematical formalisms. Here are some issues I encountered:\n   * Most of the analysis is presented in terms of the functional causal model of the dynamic model. Here, at any time $t$, we characterize the tier $H_t$, the label $Y_t$ and the decision $D_t$ as respective functions of the attribute $A_t$ and exogenous randomness $E_t$. This is okay, except that the exogenous randomness must incorporate all the past evolution of society, namely because the current tier depends on them. As such, I believe it is not true that $E_t$ are independent for different $t$, as is mentioned in the appendix (p. 16). \n   * $\\Delta_\\textrm{STIR}$ is not defined before it is characterized. I believe that, at time $t$, the definition is $\\mathbf{E}[|f_{t+1}(0,E_{t+1})-f_{t+1}(1,E_{t+1})|]- \\mathbf{E}[|f_t(0,E_t)-f_t(1,E_t)|]$. This should be stated first and foremost and the dependence on $t$ should be explicit.\n   * $q_t$ is introduced as a conditional density on the pair of tiers (for each attribute). This might lead to understand it as a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure in $\\mathbf{R}^2$, since tiers are real valued. However, this is not the case. This density is rather relative to the measure of the exogenous variables $E_t$, and should indeed always be written as a function of the value the latter takes ($\\epsilon$), as follows: $q_t(f_t(0,\\epsilon),f_t(1,\\epsilon)|d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019                                                                                                                                                                                                               )$. It is worth clarifying this, otherwise the integration in Eq. (5) or the definition on p. 16 don\u2019t make sense.\n* Some of the main results are presented in a way that hides the intuition of why they hold:\n   * Theorem 4.1\u2019s limitations of why we cannot establish tier balance is due to the fact that the only interventions we have to control continuous random variables is a pair of discrete random variables.\n   * Theorem 4.2\u2019s perfect estimator making tier balance worse is due to the fact that the dynamics in Assumption 3.6 are polarizing based on labels only.\n   * As for Theorem 4.3, there seems to be an issue in the proof. When simplifying $\\Delta_\\textrm{STIR}$ by assuming that $\\alpha_Y=0$, it seems that the values of $\\gamma$ (which determine $q_t$) are also set to something specific. If this is true, then it should also be part of the Theorem\u2019s hypothesis. \n* The experiments do not seem to strongly support the analysis. While we see the polarization caused by the perfect predictor in Fig.2, it is not clear whether the counterfactually fair one is any better, as the tiers do not appear balanced in Fig. 3(c).\n\n\n### Question to Authors:\n* I tried to understand Eq. (5). From what I gather, you wanted to not have to outright characterize the time $t+1$ quantities. Instead, you wanted to couple calculating $\\mathbf{E}[|f_{t+1}(0,E_{t+1})-f_{t+1}(1,E_{t+1})|]$ at the same time as $\\mathbf{E}[|f_t(0,E_t)-f_t(1,E_t)|]$, by using the fact that the tier dynamics allow you to know exactly what happens at time  $t+1$, conditionally on the decisions and labels. However, I\u2019m not sure the coupling is done right. Instead of pushing the $E_t$ distribution forward to get $E_{t+1}$, you are forcing them to be the same, and have this secondary integral in $\\xi$, which I am unable to make sense of. Instead, we know that conditionally on the labels, decisions, and $E_t=\\epsilon$ (or equivalently the past tiers), exactly what the future tiers will be, so why not just do:\n$$ \\Delta_\\textrm{STIR}(t) = \\sum_{d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019} P_t(d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019) \\int q_t(f_t(0,\\epsilon),f_t(1,\\epsilon)|d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019) \\cdot (|\\varphi_(t+1)(\\epsilon,d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019)-\\varphi_t(\\epsilon)|) \\mathrm{d} \\epsilon $$\nWhere $\\varphi_(t+1)(\\epsilon,d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019)$ is precisely the update given in the tables in the appendix, which depend only on the past $\\epsilon$ and the decisions and labels $d,d\u2019,y,y\u2019$.\n* In Appendix B.2, you talk about tracking individuals. This is related to the previous point, but I am not sure how you are defining individuals, based on what properties or partitioning of the population? Part of it seems to suggest a kind of probability transport, through which you couple the integrations at both times, but ultimately you are using the fact that the next time step is determined by the first given the decisions and labels. Please clarify.\n\n### Typos/Suggestions:\n- (p.3) since their different roles > because of their different roles\n- (p.5) inquiring > investigating\n- (p.6) 3.2.2 Simplification Assumptions\n\n",

The modelling of long term fairness as a dynamical systems via a causal DAG seems novel and can potentially lead to further interesting work in this direction. \n- Despite the theoretical nature of the paper, the authors make a good effort in using a running example of credit application to illustrate the approach. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- Figure 1: the paper relies on the DAG in figure 1 which shows the causal relations between the variables of interest at each time step: H (hidden socio economic status), D (decision), A (sensitive attribute), Y^ori (\"groundtruth outcome\"), Y^obs (observed outcome), and X (observed features). However, it's not clearly explained what justifies the assumed causal relationship between these variables. For example, why is H_t+1 only updated from ((H_t, Y^(ori)_t, D_t)). If H is socio-economic status, wouldn't it also be dependant on some observed features such as income? Additionally, in paragraph \"Decision-making dynamics\", it says that \"The institution (decision maker) assigns decision D_t to each individual according to the observed features (A_t, X_t,i)  and the outcome record Y^obs\". However this is not reflected in the graph. There is no arrow between Y^obs_t and D. The causal relationship between H_t, A_t and X_t are also not clarified. Overall, the assumptions made in section 2.1 and the graph are not clearly justified.\n- Y^ori vs Y^obs: Y^ori is defined as the \"(unobserved) ground truth label\" and Y^obs label. In the graph, Y^ori is a direct cause of Y^obs. I am not sure how to interpret Y^ori. If Y^ori is the potential outcome, then what does the causal arrow between Y^ori and Y_obs mean? \n- Fact 3.2: it is unclear to me why why the structural equations for D_t, Y_^ori_t and H_t are only dependent on A and a noise term when this is not reflected in the graph.
