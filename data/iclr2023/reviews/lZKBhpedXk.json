            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper \"MultiWave: Multiresolution Deep Architectures through Wavelet Decomposition for Multivariate Timeseries Forecasting and Prediction\" combines wavelet decomposition with learnable time-series models. In addition to performing wavelet analysis to split the data into frequency components, a masking approach is proposed to select a sparse set of frequencies. The framework is shown to perform better on synthetic data, as well as two real-world datasets (WESAD & Covid19). \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths.\n- the idea of the paper is clear and the paper can be nicely followed.\n- frequency decomposition is a standard tool in signal processing, and hence combination with deep learning tools is promising\n- learning the masking to prune uninformative frequencies is very promising\n\nWeaknesses.\n- Some parameter investigations that would provide insight into the method are missing: what is the impact of the mask sparsification parameter alpha on the performance? Is alpha=0 maybe the best case? Or where is the optimum? Also: The model likely performs best if the input signals are sampled at integer multiples - does performance suffer when this is not the case? By how much?\n- Table 1 shows that the results are better, but only marginally so, hence I'd expect moderate impact (e.g. in the first row, I'd argue that it might not even be significant due to overlapping error-bars - if this is true, please bold all methods in these cases).",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Overall the paper is clearly written. \n- As mentioned above, the quality of the paper could be improved by adding more experiments that support the design decisions of the paper (e.g. evidence for: is the masking useful? How and for what?).\n- while mentioned as a strength above, the fact that frequency decompositions are widely known, means the novelty of applying a pre-processing wavelet decomposition step is minimal (though it's interesting to do it in the form suggested).\n\n- Some more information on the experiments would be interesting. E.g. in Fig 5: what's the distribution of masks across all features? ",

For Algorithm 1, my understanding is that learning of the feature mask M is done in sequential iterations during the supervised learning of the forecasting task. All components with zero masks will be removed after the training. Please confirm the process above.\n2. What happens if the training set contains samples with non-zero Wavelet decomposition coefficients at all levels? Feature mask will not kick in in this case and the proposed method will degenerate to feature extractor using the Wavelet decomposition.\n3. Instead of oversampling signals with lower sampling rates, how about just concatenate all signals/features after the Wavelet decomposition and use them for the subsequent learning task? Another option is to pad signal with the low sampling rates with all zeros.\n4. Experiments look a little bit weak. Can the proposed framework improve other state-of-the-art algorithms for time series forecasting? For example, deepar, N-beats, informer and state-space based forecasting models, to name a few.\n5.
