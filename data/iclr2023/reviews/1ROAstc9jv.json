            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes the use of diffusion models (DM), more specifically the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), for modeling chirographic data such as digital handwriting, sketching, and drawings. In contrast to the mainstream autoregressive approaches on sequential chirographic data, the proposed method, CHIRODIFF, processes the entire sequence in one go and hence better captures holistic concepts over sequences. The paper demonstrates the benefits of the proposed method in a variety of tasks, including de-noising, interpolation, and temporal reconstruction of images or 2D point clouds. CHIRODIFF is also compared with various architectures implementing different model classes, and it achieves better or competitive performance in reconstruction and generation tasks on the VectorMNIST, KanjiVG, and a subset of the QuickDraw datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1- The paper applies a more powerful and expressive model class, the diffusion models, to chirographic data.\n\n2- The paper is well-motivated around the holistic view achieved by the diffusion model. I think it is a novel approach in terms of how the sequential chirographic data is treated.\n\n3- The proposed model has an interesting interpretation. At T, before any reverse diffusion steps, the chirographic structure is represented as Brownian motion. It basically treats every timestep as an independent data point by ignoring the causality. Nevertheless, it learns to transform this unstructured representation into realistic data samples. This introduces another interesting property that the model can handle sequences with arbitrary lengths and sampling frequencies (at least in theory; see the first weakness related to this). \n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1- One of the main claims of this work is the proposed model\u2019s inherent advantage for modeling continuous-time data. I am not sure if this is entirely correct, as the backbone architecture is a Bi-RNN that processes the sequence step-by-step to approximate the noise. How could CHIRODIFF be better than the baselines like SketchODE or the decoder of CoSE? In particular, the latter can reconstruct a sequence at arbitrary resolution. Isn\u2019t the underlying Bi-RNN prone to failure when the sequence length is arbitrarily increased (i.e., out-of-domain problem)?\n\n2- In the stochastic vectorization task, the reconstructions are slightly different from the perceptive input. I am not sure if this is the expected result. While the model could capture different temporal modes and preserve semantics, it changes its appearance. Could it be due to the quality of the latent condition z or the stochasticity of the diffusion model-based decoder? \n\n3- In contrast to the auto-regressive approaches, the proposed model lacks the ability to complete partial drawings. I think this is perfectly fine but it should be discussed in the paper.\n\n4- This is not a weakness per se. Considering that the paper doesn\u2019t introduce major modifications to the original diffusion model formulation, the background section on diffusion models seems a bit redundant. Some space could be saved for additional experiments, especially for ablation on the model\u2019s performance on more complex data such as the hand-drawn diagram dataset of Gervais et al. or on computational efficiency (i.e., sampling-time vs. increasing sequence lengths, design choices, etc.).\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method to model chirographic data using diffusion models. Continuous-time geometric data (i.e., chirographic data) is typically modeled via autoregressive methods which fail to capture holistic information of the temporal data. On the contrary, the proposed ChiroDiff is capable of capturing holistic concepts and remaining resilient to higher temporal sampling rate. To my knowledge, this work is the first to model chirographic data with diffusion models. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in several different applications. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\nRecently, the superiority of diffusion models has been proven in the application of image synthesis. However, no work has been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models in sequential data synthesis. This paper seems to be the first work to effectively using diffusion models to synthesize chirographic data. Therefore, I think many researchers will be interested in this paper, which makes some valuable academic contributions to the community. Despite some tiny representation problems, the paper is generally well-written and easy to follow. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1) The whole Section 3 provides a detailed description of DDPM, which is already well-known in the literature. I think this section should be shortened, removed, or integrated into Section 4 to emphasize the technical contribution of the proposed ChiroDiff.\n2) Tables with accurate evaluation values should be provided instead of just displaying plots (Fig. 5 and 6). What is worse, no qualitative comparison has been made, and no user study has been conducted. In fact, for the tasks of image/graphic synthesis, qualitative evaluation is often more important than quantitative comparison. Many people want to directly compare the performance of two image/graphic synthesis methods by inspecting their synthesis results. Therefore, I suggest showing more qualitative results obtained by the proposed ChiroDiff and other existing approaches in the manuscript and its supplemental materials. Only in this manner, the advantage and necessity of modeling chirographic data via diffusion models can be clearly verified.\n",
