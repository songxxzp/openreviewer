            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of object rearrangement and focuses particularly on the design of an object-centric planner capable of solving rearrangement tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and systematic generalization. A method, NCS, for combining object-centric representation learning with non-parametric planning is introduced. NCS uses a two-level abstract hierarchy for planning, where a set-structured first level corresponds to sets of entities, and the graph-structured second level corresponds to transitions between \u201cabstracted\u201d entities. Experiments on a few synthetic object rearrangement tasks demonstrate promising performance compared to offline MBRL and object-centric shooting-based planners.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n=======\nThe main high-level idea, which I take to be the proposition of building a higher level of abstraction on top of object-centric representations upon which it is easier to conduct long-term planning --- is solid. NCS appears to be a promising first step based on the decent empirical results on synthetic tasks.\n\nWeaknesses\n=======\nGiven that the key contribution of this paper appears, to me, to be the NCS planner as a whole (specifically, as a demonstration of how object-centric representations can be leveraged for object rearrangement tasks), NCS\u2019s design appears to rely too heavily on certain strong assumptions that cater to the synthetic rearrangement environments it is demonstrated on. I believe this makes it difficult to see how NCS\u2019s technical designs can inform future frameworks applied on more challenging environments. In particular, the treatment of object identity is highly simplistic; NCS copies the identity of each object discovered in the first step forward through time. This requires an assumption of no occlusion and no objects being introduced or leaving during an episode. \n\nI think it's important to discuss and compare against this missing related work [1] --- the question of why non-parametric planning should be conducted over abstract object-centric states versus planning directly on abstract subgoals (which may be less restrictive of an assumption?) is an interesting one.\n\nReferences\n=======\n1.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is currently written in a way that makes it difficult to parse what exactly the main claims and technical contributions are. I felt that Section 2 and Section 3 both introduced new ideas beyond what was summarized in the introduction. \n\nSection 2 purports to provide *a new formulation for goal-conditioned POMDPs*. What exactly about this formulation is *new* with respect to previous literature? References to \u201cstandard\u201d goal-conditioned POMDP problem formulation are made but no citations are given. Similarly, mentions of other \"standard\" POMDP formulations like object-oriented MDPs, relational MDPs, and factorized MDPs are mentioned without citation. My understanding of this section is that it just introduces key \u201cstructural assumptions\u201d that are being made about the entities upon which planning is performed?\n\nThe paper appears to claim the following as a novel idea: (Section 3) \u201cOur main idea is that generalizing over such a combinatorial space requires the agent to recognize that the same action for moving an object from one location to another can be reused for different objects and in different contexts\u201d. I did not feel as if this claim was properly situated within the context of relevant literature; for example, I would suggest taking a look at [1,2]. Also, in Section 3.1, *\"but **our contribution of how we structurally enforce the above three criteria** remains invariant to how the sequential Bayesian filter is implemented, which we expect will advance beyond using SA and GPT\"* what exactly is the \"contribution\" here?\n\nThe paper would also benefit from careful editing. There are many sentences that need citations, many typos, and much of the main text is constructed out of long paragraphs with lots of information that are hard to follow. It would also be helpful to clearly define concepts like states, entities, identity, entity-sets, nodes, edges, actions, etc. and provide examples to help explain them early on in the text. \n\n\n\nReferences\n=====\n1.

A scene-level embedding can still learn commonalities between scenes; however, these representations may be entangled with respect to scene objects?\n\n- Some figures need to be resized to fit the page better, as they look too tiny\n",

For example, in the heterogeneous scenario where objects are significantly different in scale (e.g. side length), we cannot directly transfer the knowledge (e.g., offline transition) of a large object to a smaller one.\n2. The planning and control algorithms are not clear. For instance, how to search for a reasonable plan without conflicts. I also cannot figure out how to align the entities concretely from only one sentence minimizes the matching cost between z_t and z_g.'.

The paper proposes a neurosymbolic approach for solving this problem.\nThe method is described as a hierarchical abstraction approach-- object representations are learned, and a factorized transition graph is constructed over these representations.  The method, \"Neural Constraint Satisfaction\" disentangles representation learning from planning and control, therefore leading to a modularized approach.

The introduction is dedicated to mostly explaining the importance and difficulty of object rearrangement, without specifying what input-output spaces are being considered -- this comes very late.\n- It would be interesting to see the method being applied to real world datasets -- i.e. images with real objects (see my suggestion 2 for prospective datasets). Perhaps in such settings, more sophisticated feature learning / entity abstraction methods would need to be used.\n- ablation study/analyses to study each module could enhance the evidence for the efficacy of the method\n\n*Suggestions*\n1.
