It's possible that an expert in this area would have been able to make more sense of the paper than I did. That being said: this paper is very unclear to a reader who is just a general expert in machine learning. Indeed, I actually still can't figure out what, precisely, this paper is about.\n\nSome illustrative examples of clarity problems:\n1. as far as I can tell, \"global counterfactual explanation\" is not defined\n\n2. it's not clear what data setup the authors have in mind. I guess these are explanations for predictive models. In section 3.1, the authors write \"x in X_sub\". In context, I guess this notation is meant to be input features. What space do these features live in? Immediately after, the paper uses x + k*\\delta, where \\delta is a vector. That would seem to imply that x is a vector of real numbers. Does this method then only work for data where the features are vectors of real numbers? \n\nSimilarly: what does subgroup mean in this context? What is a \"successful\" counterfactual? \n\nThese confusions all occur in a single sentence. I believe such things could be clarified pretty easily; the issue is that they are not currently.\n\n3. The takeaway messages from Figures 1 and 3 are totally unclear by looking at the figures. The captions do not explain the purpose of these figures.\n\n4. I can't find any result in the paper that appears to correspond to the claim, \"Global Counterfactual Explanations are reliable or efficient, but not both\"",

This paper attempts to balance efficiency and reliability for global explanation methods of model behavior, which is a valuable perspective in machine learning practice.\n2.

Overall, the experiments seem well-designed, and the results are promising. Moreover, the improvements of the proposed framework are decent over other methods and consistent in various datasets and under different settings.\n \nWeaknesses:\n1. Since the framework is built on many machine-learning models, it would be too hard to reproduce this work because it misses quite a few details, such as how to adapt to various models via different hyper-settings.\n2. Categorical Translations have their limitation, such as omitting the rules of \u2019If A then B or C\u2018.

They propose a new framework, which they call GLOBE-CE, which is based on feature translations of vectors of variable length, and provide a mathematical analysis of the implications of this for categorical features. They also improve the efficiency of an existing one (ARES), and compare the two with real world datasets and user studies.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: The key idea behind GLOBE-CE -- that if groups of instances are explained together by a single set of counterfactuals based on a translation in the input space -- is clever, and, to my knowledge, novel. The experiments seem to show that GLOBE-CE provides a good tradeoff between reliability and efficiency. The paper is very clearly written. The insights about categorical features are also interesting.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- There are, in my opinion, too many contributions in this paper for me to fully understand all of them without going through the appendix (and related work) in some detail. Between all the contributions, there appears to have not been room for exposition, definitions, and evidence. For instance, the concept of \"recourse cost\" is never precisely defined, though identifying bias in it appears to be the phenomenon of study that the methods proposed are meant to uncover. Another example is that the explanation of how AReS works is not really sufficient to follow the paper's contributions to it; I'd have to go read the original paper to understand how it works, and without that intuition, the statement that \"analyses suggest that AReS is highly dependent of the ground set V\" isn't very convincing.\n- The takeaway from the small user study is not obvious to me; measuring the effectiveness of the tool deserves a more in-depth evaluation than is provided here. (However, in a paper introducing this method I would not consider such a user study necessary.)\n- I also honestly think the title is somewhat misleading; I thought this paper would quantify reliability and efficiency and either empirically or theoretically examine those tradeoffs. Instead, the paper consists of several contributions vaguely connected by the theme of tackling reliability and efficiency.",
