Such design is ingenious and innovative.\n\n#Weakness\n1. The paper needs to further explain the rationality of introducing LV dynamic systems. Under this model, the paper proposes two latent variables and analyzes their dynamical properties.

Modeling the time-dependent relations as in Equation (2) seems not very convincing to me.\n2. The experiment description is not clear enough. \n3. The experimental results are not sufficient.

The authors do this by assuming a particular dynamic model of user interest (Lotka-Volterra) and demonstrating how a policy could be learned for recommending breaks to users in conjunction with a recommender system.  They test this on simulated user dynamics on top of Movielens ratings data to demonstrate that their learned policy is more effective than alternative approaches.\n",

The question of how to better incorporate user well being into recommender design and how we can leverage long term models to do so is an interesting and important question to study.\nS2. Under the assumed model given, the paper is thorough in exploring the learning problem and demonstrating the efficacy of their learning approach.\n\nW1. The assumed model of user dynamic is highly novel - this is a strength in that it has not been used in the recommender literature before (as far as I know) but the paper does not actually explain or demonstrate why this particular model is a good one.  The experiments do show that it is flexible for learning even assuming a more complex user model, but alternative framings of the problem (e.g. from Kleinberg et al 2022) are not compared with and no empirical evidence is given that this fits or benefits real users at all.\n\nW2. The paper does not consider a lot of recent work and important aspects of recommender systems related to the actual items being recommended.  There is a large body of literature on diversity, dynamics of user interests within and across topics, additional signals of user feedback and satisfaction, leveraging surveys, etc.  In addition to not well contextualizing this work, this  both under-leverages state-of-the-art approaches for understanding user well being and is a limitation of the assumed user model, e.g. where user interest is unidimensinoal rather than evolving across many dimensions.  \n",

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the paper is thorough in exploring a novel design space for recommender systems.  However, I believe significant additional research would be needed to demonstrate that their assumed dynamics model is reflective of real users and that their proposed approach does lead to higher long term user satisfaction.  As a result, I do not believe the paper is ready for publication at ICLR.\n",
