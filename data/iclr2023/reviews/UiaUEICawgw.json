However, existing learned indexes adopt a fixed prediction error threshold to build the index. This paper focus on the diverse characteristics of different data localities and propose a pluggable learned index framework to dynamically adjust the prediction error threshold. The experiments shows the proposed methods can achieve a better trade-off between space and time effiency.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n1. The paper present the comprehensive theoretical analysis and corresponding proofs.\n2. The proposed methods are easy to applied to all piece-wise-approximation-based learned index.\n\nWeakness:\n1. It would be clearer for readers to understand the learned index when discuss about the related work on the learned index from different optimization aspect, such as epsilon-bounded mechanism, index structure. New works should be also discussed here, such as LIPP [1] NFL [2], CARMI [3], FINEdex [4].\n\n2. The paper claims that the proposed framework has the ability to handle dynamic udpate case (Section 3.2) and the cost of the estimation for the epsilon is only paied once (Section 4.2 Indexing Building Cost). However, the experiments in the Section 4 or Appendix only includes the results on read-only workloads. The results on read-write workloads are missing. The update issues in indexing are complicated and includes several aspects of research directions. For example, to support updates, existing indexes such as LIPP [1], Alex, PGM often propose new operations to adjust the inner structure which may involve rebuilding parts of the structure. From this perspective, does the previous epsilons still fits? Or does the index need to pay the estimation cost again?\n\n3. The codes are incomplete and are all python codes. All existing learned index are implemented in C++ for obtaining the faster performance. The codes for implementing the framework or measuring the index's performance (latency or index size) are missing.\n\n[1] Jiacheng Wu, Yong Zhang, Shimin Chen, Yu Chen, Jin Wang, Chunxiao Xing.
