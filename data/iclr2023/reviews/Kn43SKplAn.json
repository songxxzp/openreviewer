            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper is proposed a method to recover (complete) the 3D reconstruction of an object category from a single depth picture. The method exploits synthetic training data and a point cloud pose canonicalization to learn a category-specific geometry. As a consequence, the learning of these 3D priors helps to retrieve the 3D reconstruction even for occluded bodies. The method is evaluated on different scenarios by using depth images or LIDAR-like point clouds; a comparison with competing techniques, ablation studies and failure cases are also reported. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The authors claim their method does not require ground truth camera pose or 3D reconstruction for supervision, being the goal to learn a category-specific 3D prior model. I have no problem with that, in fact, I like the idea. However, similar ideas were exploited in the non-rigid structure-from-motion community, a community that was not included in the discussion of this paper. I know the differences, but I feel a discussion of these approaches could help the reader. We can find some works on the literature, such as: \u201cUnsupervised 3D Reconstruction and Grouping of Rigid and Non-Rigid Categories\u201d and \u201cStructure from category: A generic and prior-less approach.\u201d\n\nThe proposed method is a combination of well-known ideas and architectures in the literature. In this context, the technical contribution is a bit poor. \n\nBe consistent with notation. For example, see x in Fig. 2 and Eqs. (1), (2), etc. \n\nReproducibility: some weight coefficient values, for example, see Eq. (7) are never provided in the main paper. \n\nA calibrated camera is required. This should be commented on in the introduction. \n\nWhy not use additional categories? A priori, I think more everyday categories are included in the datasets the authors are using, so I cannot understand why just three are considered. \n\nThe authors report quantitative evaluation in terms of chamfer distance and F1 score. To be honest, for a 3D reconstruction algorithm I would hope for a different metric where we evaluate the 3D model, instead of one based on chamfer deviation. \n\nThe method provides a good performance in comparison with competing techniques. Moreover, it can handle occlusion properly. However, the occlusion seems not to be very realistic. Instead of that, I would like to see some cases where the occlusion can explain a natural and real case. The method can naturally also handle missing observations.\n\nI agree with the authors; the proposed method produces more smooth solutions to the point of avoiding capturing details. Can the authors imagine an explanation of that?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "In general, the paper is well written and it is clear enough. While the contribution seems to be a bit incremental, or a combination of previous models and ideas, the experimental analysis and the final results are competitive. In terms of reproducibility, I feel the authors also provide most of the details we need to reproduce the results. ",

It would be interesting to see a more thorough evaluation or demonstration. \n\nWeakness:\n- It is not clear how fast the method runs in practice, especially considering that it requires segmenting the objects from the image or point cloud and lifting the point cloud to the canonical coordinate frame.\n- The proposed method seems to be a combination of ideas from existing works. The novelties over these existing works are not clearly discussed. \n- Several parts of the paper need to be revised. \n  - Abstract \"A limitation of current color image-based 3D reconstruction models is that they do not generalize across datasets\": this should only apply to learning based methods.\n  - 2.1 \"Neural rendering and neural fields provide an alternative representation to overcome these limitations.
