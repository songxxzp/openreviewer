The authors propose their criteria of choosing baseline values based on the observation that \" incorrect baseline values generate\nnew causal pattern\". While this observation is quite intuitive, why is the converse true? That is, it is a bit hard to see why minimizing the number of causal patterns would provide a good baseline value. \n- Clarity weakness: \n2. A minor point: Theorem 3 needs to be more concise. Is it possible to move part of it into a different property, or remark, or derivations ahead of the formal theorem? \n- Complexity of the algorithm: There is a trade-off between complexity and accuracy when we approximate the optimization. In practice, the proposed algorithm could be computationally intensive to get good baseline values, in particular for complex problems with higher orders of interactions. ",

The performance shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n- The approximate-yet-efficient solution is nice to reduce the low-order causal patterns and the number of salient causal patterns.\n\nConcerns\n\n- The problem is not defined clearly. Could you clarify the relationship between the absence of states of the input variables and the absence of the causal effect of the input variables at the beginning? It seems that the masking method you seek is actually aiming to remove the causal effect of the masked variable. It's confusing to not have a clear description of the problem right off the bat of what you are to remove by masking.\n\n- The presentation and some clarification issues. Some fundamental concepts need to be clarified. For example, could you please explain what it means by \u2018removing causal pattern\u2019 and \u2018introducing causal pattern\u2019 when you first mention it? Also, in this paper, the masking method is considered as faithfully representing the absence states of input variables if it faithfully removes old causal patterns without introducing new causal patterns. But first, to make it clearer, could you please present this definition more formerly; second, for me, it is not that straightforward to define it from this perspective. For example, I am confused about why masking $forehand$ should remove the information of the whole pattern $\\\\{forehand, eyes, beak\\\\}$. Even the causal effect of $forehand$ can be removed, is there any proof here? Moreover, could you please give some explanation on why the masking method should be considered in this way?  Is there a loss of information except for the masked variable? If yes, is there any metric for such a loss?\n\n- What is the computational complexity of the proposed method to estimate the optimal baseline values?\n",
