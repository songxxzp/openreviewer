This paper achieves a spatially correct matching between the topological features (persistence barcodes) of label (ground truth) and prediction (output of the neural network).\n\n2. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm to compute TopoMatch for images. This paper shows that TopoMatch is an interpretable metric to evaluate the topological correctness of segmentations. It is better than the Betti number as an evaluation metric.\n\n3. Matching L & G directly has spatial matching issues; using induced matching via map C helps with spatially correct matching.\n\n4.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper provides a metric TopoMatch to evaluate the topological correctness of image segmentation masks. TopoMatch matching is based on induced matching and its advantage over Wasserstein matching is its consideration of spatial correspondence of topological features. Also, TopoMatch can be used as a loss to improve the segmentation results. This method is evaluated on six datasets. Although the segmentation accuracy is not always the best, its topological correctness performs best in all experiments.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n +) This paper works on an interesting and important task, the topological correctness of segmented masks. \n\n +) The proposed TopoMatch sounds reasonable according to its description and experimental results. \n\nWeakness:\n\n -) The writing of this paper could be greatly improved for a better understanding. For instance, more detailed explanations of figures are desired. In Fig.1, it says the same color means the matched cycles. How about white color? A further explanation of Fig.1 in the main text is missing, which takes time to get the information this figure conveys.  Also, the main content should be self-contained and understandable without the need of an appendix. However, in Section 3.3, the reader needs to read the appendix to understand #ker and #coker. \n\n-) More explanation of the physical meaning of TopoMatch is desired. What is p in the TopoMatch loss equation? \n\n-) The comparison image is defined as C = min(L, G) in the main text, while in the caption of Fig.7, it is defined as C = max(L, G). Why the TopoMatch matching is the composition of two induced matching? \n\n-) The contribution of this paper should be explicitly pointed out. It seems like the main contribution is the use of two-induced matching to define a new metric, which seems to be incremental. \n\n-) The experimental results show that the correction of the topology of segmentation hinders the improvement of segmentation accuracy. Also, once the dice score is over 0.9, the topology correctness, even the spatial correspondences, would not be a big issue, as demonstrated by the Betti number. Is it necessary to have such a complex term in the loss function? Or can we choose a good segmentation mode and just use the Betti number as a constraint? It seems like improving the segmentation accuracy is another good way to correct the topological issues of segmentation. So, in what situations, we do need the topology correctness term? \n\n-) Perhaps more descriptions on the meat of this paper while concisely introducing some background and making connections to the method proposed in this paper.

Finally the authors provide an exhaustive set of numerical experiments showcasing the efficiency of the new loss.",

It seems that composing these two matchings would already provide better segmentations than the Wasserstein distance between L and G. Why are induced matchings better than this?\n---Optimizing losses based on persistent homology usually requires heavy mathematics (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/carriere21a.html, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10208-021-09522-y), so I was wondering if the gradient of TopoMatch is well defined also, and if it enjoys some kind of convergence guarantees?",
