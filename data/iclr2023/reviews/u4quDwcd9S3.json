            "summary_of_the_paper": "Deep learning-based forecasting techniques for multi-variate time series forecasting have largely replaced more traditional techniques in recent years. However, there is an overall lack of consensus on the effectiveness of such methods overall, and the value of using more complex transformer-based methods has become increasingly incremental. In this work, the authors combine standard practices of time series decomposition into trend and seasonality components with channel-wise sequence dependencies in order to obtain multi-step-ahead forecasts in a more principled and efficient manner. The authors also consider an extension to this method that applies contrastive learning to the seasonal components. The authors verify the effectiveness of these models by applying them to a selection of time series forecasting and anomaly detection problems.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "- The proposed models combine classical decomposition-based approaches for time series forecasting with more recent deep learning techniques. The experiment results indicate that they perform consistently well across a variety of datasets, often outperforming competing methods. \n- I also appreciate that the experimental evaluation is fairly extensive, and considers a variety of both time series forecasting datasets, as well as anomaly detection benchmarks.\n\n-------\n\n- Overall, I found that the paper lacks focus, and I\u2019m not sure why anomaly detection is featured so prominently in the title and introduction, when there doesn\u2019t seem to be much contribution in that area? I see anomaly detection in this case as being a downstream task from forecasting, and it stands to reason that improved forecasts should in turn result in more reliable anomaly detection. There does not seem to be any other contribution to anomaly detection beyond this however, and the focus of the paper remains on time series forecasting.\n- The paper contains a fair amount of typos and would have definitely benefited from more thorough proofreading before submission. I advise the authors to look out for these when preparing a future revision.\n- It seems like the majority of the paper\u2019s contributions are quite empirically-driven, with claims such as \u201cWe also tried to utilise a trend component \u2026 but the performance is not improved when compared with the mean value.\u201d While I appreciate this practical tip, the insight comes across as superficial overall, and it feels as though there was less underlying theoretical motivation for the architecture of the model.\n- The inclusion of the contrastive learning element also only has marginal value, and may even distract from the focus of the decomposition-based dual projection model that is the primary contribution.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The proposed architectures of DBDP and DBDPC are novel, but they also borrow very heavily from existing papers on transformer-based models and contrastive learning for forecasting. I think the paper\u2019s focus on anomaly detection is currently misleading as, unless I\u2019ve misunderstood, this is here purely a downstream task that benefits from a method yielding better forecasts. I think the paper would benefit from major rewriting overall - the Related Work section currently takes up a lot of space in the main paper, which could instead be used to describe DBDP in more detail. It would also be helpful to include more illustrative figures/synthetic examples that showcase how the model compares against existing methods.",

The contribution is incremental since it looks like a combination of several existing techniques.\n2. The description of the proposed method is unclear. For example, how to perform time series decomposition and dual projection? how to perform prediction under current modeling framework? The authors are suggested to elaborate on the implementations of the proposed model.\n3. Appendix A mentioned the ablation study of the anchor. What is the anchor in the proposed method? The reviewer did not find the description of \u201canchor\u201d in the main text.\n4.
