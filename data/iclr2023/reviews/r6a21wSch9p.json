            "strength_and_weaknesses": "There is a total lack of transparency in this paper as to what is the new loss function - and this ambiguity starts from not having any clarity about how is a supposed interpolation being done from the sampled non-equispaced points to a new sample of equispaced points.  I believe that the $\\tilde{\\cal F}$ in equation 7 and 8 is what is replacing the ${\\cal F}$ in equation 4. But this is only my guess and this still doesn't really define what is the new replacement of the basic equation 3 of FNO.  \n\nEquations 6,7,8 and the periodic heat kernel are all seemingly defined in terms of their resampled equispaced points. Its entirely as to where and how the given non-equispaced points got used. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The presentation is quite unclear. There is also some issue with the novelty here since DeepONets are anyway a superset of FNO and they work fine with randomly sampled data. So where is the evidence that this new form of FNO will beat what DeepONets anyway do? \n\nAlso the testing is extremely weak since consistently the authors seem to be working in the regime of test data being much smaller than training data. This is very problematic - because no evidence is shown that the risk estimates have even converged for such small test data sizes. ",

The authors draw some analogs between vision mixer models and FNO and then build over it to obtain the non-equispaced FNO. For the non-equispaced FNO, the authors use a non-equispaced interpolation function that helps construct an equispaced signal and thus helps use FNO for the PDE solving. The idea is novel, and the results show improvement over FNOs, and further, they also overcome memory issues to some extent. ",

But methods such as DeepONets are cited but not compared against.\n- the theory (theorem 3.1) provided is not giving any insights but is only provided to prove something that the authors don't relate with the results obtained. It's as if the theory is not meant to prove anything but that approximations exist. I did a random search of where theorem 3.1 is cited in the whole paper and didn't find any references in the results or the rest of the main paper.",

Some notations such as d_a and d_u and for that matter d could have been explained a bit more... but I would understand if the authors skipped elaborating a bit more due to page limit constraints. At the same time, the paper seems to be written in a bit of a rush (naturally expected, but have to make a note of it here). \n\nQuality: The work is novel. But, is it novel enough to publish in ICLR, just on the merit of significant results compared to FNO? I don't think so. Nevertheless, the authors did a commendable job presenting the results and all comparisons with other methods, etc. But that still doesn't give an impact in terms of a paper in ICLR.\n\nOriginality: this work is original.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The work proposed by the authors is certainly novel; the paper proposed a non-equispaced Fourier Neural PDE solver, and the contributions include (I) some connection between vision mixers and FNOs (ii) the development of NEI layer to obtain non-equispaced FNO (iii) significant results compared to baseline. \n\nThe contributions are somewhat like incremental research with minimal improvement over the SoTA. Hence, I recommend a weak reject. What could convince me is (i) some more comparison with standard neural PDE solvers (ii) Some more theory on what kind of sampling strategies one should try or something (iii) and/or some more results which can be related to the theory proposed.

Also the paper has a careful ablation study.\n\nWeakness: using interpolation to address the mesh points dataset is not very new. Previous works have directly applied interpolation and used FNO as in (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05512). As shown in Table 3, the learned interpolation is not very significant from the plain Gaussian interpolation baseline.\n\nOther comments\n- In section 4.3, NFS outperforms FNO on the equispaced problem. This is somewhat counter-intuitive. I wonder if the improvement on equispaced problems attributes to differences in architecture such as channel mixing and layernorm, etc.\n- A recent work (Geo-FNO) proposes a similar architecture with a different theoretical formulation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05209).
