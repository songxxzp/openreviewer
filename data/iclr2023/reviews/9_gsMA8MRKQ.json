            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes a pseudoinverse-guided diffusion model for solving (nonlinear) inverse problems using model-agnostic pre-trained score-based diffusion model (SDM) networks. The key component of the proposed in $\\Pi$GDM is the approximation of the conditional probability $p_t(y|x_t)$, which is based on Tweedie's formula and Gaussian assumption. With known $p_t(y|x_t)$, $\\Pi$GDM can the term as guidance to guide the generation of the image.\n\nIn summary, I think the contributions of the work are:\n1. Propose an approach to approximately calculate $p_t(y|x_t)$.\n2. Demonstrate the efficacy of the model on various (nonlinear) inverse problems, including JPEG restoration, image impainting, and image super-resolution.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:**\n1. Open code and data\n2. Thorough supplement\n3. Proposal of a new approach to compute $p_t(y|x_t)$\n\n**Weakness:**\n\n*Statement:*\n1. The statement \"To the best of our knowledge, \u03a0GDM is the first approach based on problem-agnostic models to achieve this quality on ImageNet.\" might be too ambitious. I found a concurrent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14687) that also uses model-agnostic DPM for solving the general inverse problem and achieves very good results. A thorough comparison with existing methods needs to be presented to support this argument.\n2. I am not very clear what are the contributions of this work by reading the manuscript. I felt that using 'guidance' to condition DPM has already become a common strategy and many papers have investigated this problem. Perhaps it is due to my misunderstanding, but the text seems to imply that making model-agnostic pre-trained DPM work for specific inverse problems is one novelty/contribution tied to the paper.\n\n*Methodology:*\n\n3. The underlying assumption for \u03a0GDM to approximate $p_t(y|x_t)$ is that $p_t(x_0|x_t)$ is Gaussian, which is strong. For example, assume $p_t(x_t|x_0)$ is Gaussian and $p(x_0)$ is Gaussian as well. According to Baye's rule, \n$$p(x_0|x_t) = \\frac{p_t(x_t|x_0)p(x_0)}{p(x_t)}$$\nfor which a Gaussian approximation is too strong.\n\n4. Therefore, the practicality of the model might be severely limited.\n\n*Experiment:*\n\n5. In the experiments, the baseline methods are restricted to model-specific methods, failing to include other model-agnostic methods such as plug-and-play prior (PnP). It will be also helpful to see if \u03a0GDM improves over existing model-agnostic methods.",
