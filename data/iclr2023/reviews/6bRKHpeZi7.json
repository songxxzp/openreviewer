            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n- The paper is of interest, as it shows how to modify a CNN in order to perform image inversion in a similar eway to humans. If we aim at creating neural nets that ressemble most to humans, these are lines to follow.\n- The paper is very nicely written, and easy to read.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-First, I am surprised that the authors completely ignore in the paper that these ideas of looking wether a CNN performs as humans in different tasks has been around for some time. Clear examples of this are [1,2] regarding color and brightness illusions, the Scilliation rig [3], the perception on liquids [4], or contrast sentitivity functions [5]. I believe the authors need a state-of.the-art section including all this line of research.\n\n- The authors perform all the experiments in ResNet-50. I believe that, for a paper as this one, at least a couple of different neural networks architectures should be used. If not, how can we sure that this results do not only hold true for the ResNet architecture.\n\n- The authors in page 2 say that CNN are translational invariant. This is currently not fully agreed by the community, as recent studies have shown that this is not the case. See [6]. For this reason, authors need to comment on this fact.\n\n- The last experiment is not clear. Why cosine similarity? Why not to use any other metric? Can the authors ellaborate?\n\n- Finally, I recommend the authors to remove the last line of the paper. I do not agree that the inversion effect happens in V1. They prove that a log-polar transformation helps, that is suppose to be in V1; however, there is still a long way to claim for that.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This article is interested in the so-called \"Inversion effect\" in human vision: the fact that although humans are as a rule excellent at recognising and discriminating faces, performance falls to very low levels when faces are seen upside down. This is an interesting effect as we are generally apt at recognising objects in various poses. \n\nThe authors' two hypotheses are that i) the log-polar mapping of the early visual system (retina+V1) plays a role in this effect (this is implicit in the paper's methodology); and 2) that this effect is explained by visual expertise: ie, that face recognition is a highly specialised competency that depends on complex configurations that are disrupted when a face is seen upside-down. \n\nThe paper's hypotheses are examined by recognition experiments using standard CNNs and a proposed log-polar neural network (so-called LPNet), on recognition tasks using faces and other objects as a baseline. Visual expertise is modeled as the number of classes the networks have to discriminate. \n\nResults show that: \n- validation performance drops with the number of classes in all cases. \n- validation performance drops faster for inverted stimuli\n- performance on inverted stimuli tends to be worse for the CNN compared to LPNet\n- CNNs appear to be more reliant on global configurations than LPNet",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths\n- The paper is generally clear and well written, with a clear description of the  experimental design. \n- The hypotheses are well framed with respect to the literature on the topic\n- The experimental setup is generally clear and well chosen. \n- Effects such as the inversion effect are interesting to study as they could link the high performance of the human visual system to specialisation in processing.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Relevance to ICLR: I am not fully convinced that ICLR is the right venue for this work. Although the methodology involves neural networks, the hypothesis and conclusion are relevant to the human visual system and psychology in particular. Due to the experimental choices (mainly, artificially limited data augmentation), the results have limited bearing to the study of artificial neural networks or computer vision in general. \n- Some of the experimental results seem fairly obvious: A CNN trained with limited rotation fails at recognising examples under large rotation/inversion. A network that had some additional rotation training due to design (log-polar mapping) performs better. \n- The central argument that the inversion effect is due to the fact that recognition is mediated by configurations that are disrupted by inversion is not really supported by the experimental setup or results: the configurations learnt by a CNN are not robust to rotation if only limited rotations were included in the training data. This is a consequence of known limitations of CNN and of experimental design, but what does it say about humans? We see faces in much a wider variety of poses than suggested by the dataset? \n- Is the conclusion any deeper than: learning systems can recognise patters in similar conditions than the ones they were exposed to during training? \n- In Experiment III, it is not clear how large each \"set of images\" is. It would be good also to have a measure of variance on those numbers, as I expect it may be quite large depending on the face configuration.  \n- The argument about visual expertise could be refined in my view. In Figure 4, the loss in accuracy due to inversion climbs up to 20 classes and to a lesser extent up to 60, but seems fairly stable after that. It is unclear why visual expertise would plateau in this manner (error bars are also extremely large on the LPNet graph). ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is generally clearly written and describes the experimental design well. \n\nOne key argument in the paper was unclear to me: that a log-polar representation, when fed into a CNN provides rotation and scale invariance. I cannot understand why this is the case from the explanations given: A CNN provides translation invariance, and rotation and scale robustness is only achieved through training on augmented data. In a V1-like log-polar representation, the scale and orientation of a pattern's encoding is dependent on its excentricity, therefore translation in the image leads to a change in scale and orientation. I am not clear how this equates to invariance though (beside the fact that cropping-based data augmentation will implicitly train for rotation+scale robustness): a rotated picture will have different encoding than the original. This should be better explained as this is central to the explanation of the experimental results. \n\nAnother aspect that would warrant more explanation is the rather large variance seen in some of the graphs\n\nThe LPNet model could have been described in more specifics: I have a fairly clear idea on what it does, but would probably not be able to reimplement it exactly.\n\nThe paper uses a custom dataset for faces, that was not provided at reviewing time. For the other visual classes the dataset is a subset of ImageNet, but the indices of those images are unknown. \n\nProviding the code and all stimuli for the experiments would be essential to ensure reproducibility. \n\nOne minor issue: one reference is missing in page 9 (ie, [REF])",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In summary, I find the research idea interesting, but I have a number of concerns about the paper as it stands: \n- Although the research question and hypotheses are interesting, it is not fully clear to me that the experiments really validate the hypotheses, and that the contrived experimental setup allows for conclusions that are not already well known. \n- To justify presentation at ICLR, it would be important that the authors clarify what are the contributions and implications of their findings for computer vision and neural networks research. If the main contribution is psychological in nature maybe this is not the best venue for this paper. \n- Code and data would need to be made available to allow reproduction of the results. ",

If humans can recognize faces without foveation, then how does that results fit into this methodology? I could argue the same for log-polar mapping.\n\nPerhaps a missing experiment that remains to be done here is to re-do the experiments with the faces shrunken to the foveal area of the log-polar mapping and later evaluate the outcomes? Quite frankly, I'm also a bit confused, as I'm not sure how to make sense of these results even by having the log-polar network as a control. Maybe there is a confounding variable in this analysis, but I can't wrap my head around what the confounding variable is or could be. \n\nIt occurs to me that maybe some additional experiments could be done with scenes, but I'm not sure what is to be proven: perhaps that there is no image inversion effects in scenes? (I'm arguing for scenes here because that is a believable scenario where I can see having a model that incorporates a wide field of view through a log-polar transform be plausible -- similar to Deza & Konkle, ArXiv 2020.)\n\nMissing references:\n* Brain-like functional specialization emerges spontaneously in deep neural networks, by Dobbs et al.
