            "summary_of_the_paper": "The proposed approach address the problem of class-incremental for weakly supervised semantic image segmentation. The goal of this paper is to leverage the semantic relations among the labels to improve the weakly supervised learning for semantic segmentation. The idea is to generalize the WILSON approach for weakly semantic image segmentation. A new loss relation aware semantic prior loss (RASP) is developed to encourage the forward transfer across classes within the learning sequence. The proposed loss is validated in continuous learning setting.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros\n\nThe approach naturally generalized the prior works on image-classification to the weakly semantic image segmentation, which is novel and inspiring. I think approaching the problem from the loss perspective is reasonable.\n\nThe proposed approach seems to be working well on the proposed settings. The proposed approach shows good results in the settings of effect of memory and few-shot. \n\nCons\n\nThe proposed approach is relative not incremental on top of the WILSON project. As the main idea in this paper is to add the RASP loss on top of the WILSON framework. However, it does not seem that the additional RASP loss adds the big advantages to the WILSON framework. More experiments should be provided to justify if the additional useful signals are provided from the localizer. Specifically, we need to see improvements of the slice and dice metric improvements of the new classes once we have applied the RASP loss and use the information from the old class. The Baseline in that setting is that we are not using RASP loss, but just run CRF-like approach. \n\nAnother question is about the RASP loss. There is no guarantee that the localizer for old tasks is providing the positive impact to the new tasks, unless we have made some careful choice on the old tasks and new tasks, which is not possible in the real-world use cases. How would one use the proposed approach in practice?\n\nOne design choice needs to be justified. In particularly, the proposed approach chooses to treat the new class region as background and build the proposed approach on a localizer module trained with weak annotations. In contrast, there are multiple approaches in literatures in salient region detection that shows promising results in segmenting the background, and plenty of the approaches using super-pixels. It is not clearly why the proposed approach pick up the route, which seems to be bias towards to give better thing-like object instance segmentation. The proposed technical choice might not work well on the stuff-like objects instances, which has extended boundaries. These are missed out in the discussion.\n\nThe experiments are mostly focus on the easy datasets such as Pascal and COCO. For the proposed to work, I would like to see how the proposed approach work on a more challenging dataset. The simulated experiments on new and old classes seem to be cherry picked.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\nThe paper does do well in present the core idea of the proposed approach. However, it is not very clear about the key difference between the proposed approach and the one from WILSON. \n\nQuality\nThe paper is presented in a good quality. The experiments have also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach in several continuous learning setting. \n\nNovelty\nThe paper has a incremental contribution on top of the WILSON work.\n\n\nReproducibility\nThe paper seems to be easily reproduced.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "On the positive side, I think the proposed approach has good spirit as it has shown clear improvements on class-incremental setting for weakly semantic image segmentation. The proposed approach has also touched the drawbacks of the WILSON framework, and added the new loss RASP which encourages the forward transfer across classes within the continuous learning setting. However, the paper does not seem to show clear improvements. The aggregated metric improvements on the benchmarks do not guarantee that the improvements are from the proposed RASP loss. There are other technical design choices are not well justified.\n",

For instance, how to take into account stronger relations between classes than just embedding similarity ones? For instance, in semantic segmentation part-whole relations or spatial relations between classes could also be of great interest and the proposed approach can not differentiate between the different types of relations.\n+ Since the claim of the paper is to use conceptual relations between past and new classes, I would appreciate more experiments focusing on these specific points: for instance a setting with explicit relations between the different incremental steps and various configurations: specialization relations, generalization relations, mereo-topological relations... \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a weakly-supervised incremental semantic segmentation strategy, which starts from a base learning task with fully-annotated images and then incrementally learns novel classes with image-level labels only. To tackle this problem, it introduces a pseudo label generation method for the weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) at each incremental stage, which infers the pseudo labels of the new classes based on the model prediction of the old classes and the semantic similarity between new & old categories in a word embedding space. The proposed WSSS loss is then integrated into an existing weakly-supervised incremental semantic segmentation framework,  WILSON,  in order to build a full pipeline.  The authors evaluate the method on the PASCAL VOC dataset and COCO-to-VOC benchmark with comparisons to prior methods.   ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The problem setup of this work, which requires only weak annotation in incremental semantic segmentation, is useful in practice but less explored. \n- The idea of exploring semantic similarity for forward transfer seems novel for the task of weakly-supervised incremental segmentation. \n- The paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow.    \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The overall novelty of the proposed framework is limited. It heavily relies on the existing framework WILSON and the main contribution is an improved WSSS loss integrated within each incremental step. \n- The assumption on the background class is problematic for incremental segmentation. This work seems to assume a static background class, which is not true in this task. Due to this background drifting issue, the proposed pseudo label generation strategy seems less effective: In equation (2), the bkg class would have a high similarity to previous bkg class which includes novel classes. This would largely suppress the new classes and conflict with the CAM loss. To make this work, it seems to require a good base segmentation network to generate foreground masks, which is difficult for the incremental setup. \n- The experimental results are mixed or marginally improved compared to the WILSON framework. On some task settings of the VOC benchmark, the overall improvements are around 1% and on some task settings of the COCO-to-VOC benchmark, the proposed method is inferior to the baseline. \n- The experimental evaluation settings are limited. All of them start from a base learning task with many classes (15 or 60) and incrementally learn a smaller number of classes (5 or 20). It should be evaluated on more challenging settings with fewer base classes and more novel classes. Also, the evaluation on larger datasets in ISS, such as ADE, should be added.     ",
