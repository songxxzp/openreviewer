This method is called AudioPure which is achieved by the off-the-shelf diffusion model's generation. AudioPure adds noise to the adversarial audio and then utilizes the reverse sampling step to purify the noisy audio. AudioPure is employed as a plug-and-play module for any pretrained classifier. The experiments are conducted on representative datasets to show the robustness achieved by AudioPure under white-box and black-box attacks. ",

As shown in Table 2, there are different optimized diffusion steps faced with different attack budgets. And how to decide the optimal value for an input audio with unknown budgets?\n\n3.

The paper proposes to use DiffWave and DiffSpec to be able to operate in time and time-frequency domains. The theory behind SDE is thoroughly discussed. SDE modifications to get cleaner audio is very interesting.\nThe choice of end application is Speech Command Recognition. There are many experiment sub-sections. Mainly the proposed technique is compared with Adversatial training method. Tuning experiments include varying PGD steps for attack, EOT size, n*, choice of classifier, \naudio features, and RS variance. In all experiments, proposed technique shows promise.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Providing code is encouraging.\n2. Breath of experiments is great.\n3.

The training of DiffWave and DiffSpec is not modified to account for adversarial noise.\n2. Comparison with four-year old Adversarial training is not enough. DefenseGAN and denoiser defense are close to state-of-the-art defenses.

Although, continuous-time diffusion equations are hard to understand for readers without background.\nNovelty is low as plug-and-play scheme of a model is too simple.
