            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an extension of Generative Flow Networks (GEFlowNets). The main idea is to incorporate intermediate rewards as well as terminal rewards into the objective, which was missing in GEFlowNets. The paper proposes to combine two variants: edge-based augmentation and state-based augmentation and shows that adding intrinsic rewards leads to the same solution when intrinsic rewards converge to 0 over time. The empirical results on a grid world and a molecule generation task show that the proposed method significantly outperforms GEFlowNets and other RL baselines including PPO when combined with RND-like intrinsic rewards. Besides, it discovers more diverse set of solutions compared to the previous approaches thanks to the additional intrinsic rewards. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "[Strength]\n\n* The proposed idea of incorporating intermediate rewards to GEFlowNets is novel.\n* The result convincingly demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms the previous approach (GEFlowNets) both in terms of performance and the diversity of solutions.\n* The paper is well-written.\n\n[Weaknesses]\n\n* **Lack of result on standard RL benchmark:** To my understanding, the proposed method is general enough to be applied to any RL problems as it can incorporate intermediate rewards, and the introduction was also written in such a way. However, all of the experiments were conducted on the \"reward-at-termination\" types of environments, while intermediate rewards were given by intrinsic rewards (not from the environment). It would be much more comprehensive to evaluate the proposed method on a standard RL benchmark (e.g., Atari) that contain \"intermediate extrinsic\" rewards. \n\n* **Lack of clarity about intermediate rewards / intrinsic rewards:** Related to the above point, I felt that the paper often assumes that intermediate rewards = intrinsic rewards without a clear distinction, which I found confusing. In page 5, for example, it says \"our edge-based reward augmentation could motivate the agent to discover other paths ...\". Does the diversity of the solution come from the incorporation of intermediate rewards (i.e., the edge-based augmentation) or the combination of the edge-based augmentation and a particular intrinsic rewards designed for exploration? I believe that the paper meant the latter. I would be good to make this distinction clear throughout the paper.\n\n* **Lack of clarity about edge-based augmentation vs state-based augmentation:** I found it difficult to understand the different behaviors between the edge-based augmentation and the state-based augmentation. Why does the edge-based augmentation tend to explore \"locally\" while the state-based augmentation explores more \"globally\"? I could not figure it out from the equations immediately. Further clarifying this point would be helpful for justifying the joint approach.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "\n* Clarity: In general, the paper is well-written except a few points I raised above (see weaknesses). \n\n* Quality: The paper provides compelling experiments against the related prior approach (GEFlowNets). The comparison to standard RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) could be a bit misleading without presenting results on standard RL benchmarks. \n\n* Novelty: Although the overall method builds upon GEFlowNets, the incorporation of intermediate rewards is novel.\n\n* Reproducibility: The paper provided some details in the appendix and proposed to release the code upon publication.

This paper extends GEFlowNets nicely to support intermediate rewards, which sounds like an exciting direction towards solving RL problems with GEFlowNets. Although the results are limited to the intrinsic rewards on specific types of problems, the comparison to the prior work GEFlowNets looks quite promising and convincing. I am willing to increase the score if the authors reflect (or provide a reasonable response to) some of my comments above.",
