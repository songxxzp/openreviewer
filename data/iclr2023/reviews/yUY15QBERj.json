The objective is to perturb the sequence of graphs to decrease accuracy on prediction tasks such as dynamic link prediction and node classification. To preserve temporal dynamics of the graph to avoid detection, the authors propose the temporal dynamics-aware perturbation (TDAP) constraint. They then propose a projected gradient descent algorithm to identify effective perturbations that satisfy the TDAP constraint. They demonstrate strong empirical performance when attacking three different discrete-time GNNs.\n",

More investigation should be conducted as to why this is happening, beyond just a conjecture.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What is the meaning of the notation $\\mathbf{S}_t \\leq \\varepsilon_t$ in line 4 of Algorithms 1 and 3? On one side of the inequality, you have a matrix, and on the other side, you have a scalar. Is there supposed to be $\\ell_1$ norm around $\\mathbf{S}_t$?\n2. Also for line 4 in Algorithms 1 and 3, why randomized rounding using Bernoulli($\\mathbf{s}_t^{(N)}$) rather than just directly rounding? Can you guarantee that the discretized $\\mathbf{S}_t$ satisfies the TDAP constraint, and not just the continuous $\\mathbf{s}_t$?\n3. How is a standard deviation of 6.37 for the EV of EvolveGCN possible when the mean is 0.81, and EV must be greater than 0 according to Equation (7)? Similarly, I see error bars going into the negatives in Figure 6.\n\nTypos and minor issues:\n- Some minor inconsistencies in notation in Algorithm 1: I believe the vectors $\\mathbf{a^{(i)}}$ and $\\mathbf{s^{(i)}}$ should also have subscript $t$, and $s_t^{(N)}$ should actually be a vector $\\mathbf{s}_t^{(N)}$.\n- Abstract and Section 5.1: \"upto\" -> \"up to\"\n",

The paper is mostly well written, but some important points are unclear (see my questions above), and there are some notation issues.\n- Quality: Medium. There are potentially some technical issues with some experiment results, but the proposed TDAP constraint and TD-PGD methods seem mostly sound.\n- Novelty: High. There is both high methodological and empirical novelty in this paper. The TDAP constraint and TD-PGD attack method constitutes the methodological novelty, while the results on attack vulnerability for the three different GNNs constitutes the empirical novelty that may be useful beyond this paper.\n- Reproducibility: Medium. Lots of details on experiment setup are provided in the appendix, along with code. I skimmed through some of the code but did not run it. Some of the results seem implausible, so I don't know how reproducible they would be.\n",

Theoretical proofs are given.\n\nThe author proposed TD-PGD as an attack approach on dynamic graph models. I have the following questions that are mainly related to the proposed constraints.\n\n1. Limiting the impact of attack perturbations on the change rate of structures and embeddings sounds reasonable, but it would be conditional. Nowadays, spatial- and spectral-based anomaly detection techniques on graphs are developing rapidly. The attack constraint on dynamic graphs is fundamental to this task, thus the authors should give a rigorous proof about why and when anomaly detection algorithms fail in the face of the proposed constraints.\n2. The proof is not rigorous. First, although the bound is proven, there is no limit to the constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which might seriously affect the average change preservation. Second, the change of a matrix is directional, it is unreasonable to just consider the norm of average changes. To my knowledge, spectral anomaly detection methods can effectively capture the anomaly caused by the change directions.\n3. The proof is inconsistent with the target. It is not clear how the proven bound echoes the word \u2018preserves\u2019. A small enough $\\overline{dA\u2019}$ instead limits the dynamics of dynamic graphs, which increases risk being detected. I think at least the following formula should be proved:  $\\vert \\overline{dA\u2019}-\\overline{dA} \\vert \\leq \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the bound to make the perturbed structure change rate preserved. \u2018Implications\u2019 are intuitively sound, but theoretical proof might be flawed.\n4. The authors are suggested to empirically demonstrate that anomaly detection is insensitive to the proposed attack method. If the attack itself is easily detected, the performance drop may be ineffective.\n",
