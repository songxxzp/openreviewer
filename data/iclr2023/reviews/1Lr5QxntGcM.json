The main issue when increasing the communication speed is ISI (inter-symbol interference), which is traditionally solved using an equalizer. A very good equalizer is the forward-backward algorithm, but it is prohibitively high in computational complexity. This paper presents a learned equalizer, which has lower computational complexity in some cases, while retaining good bit error rate performance.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n\u2014-------------------\n\nThe paper has many strengths and is tackling an important problem. For the sake of time  I am only writing about weaknesses in this review, since those are the ones that should be actioned upon.\n\nWeaknesses (W)\n\n\u2014--------------------\n\nW: this paper is about applying neural network to replace a specific algorithm, namely the equalizer of a wired connection receiver. This makes the impact of the paper low for the machine learning community. Which of the finding can be generalized to other domains and how? If this cannot be described, maybe this paper is better suited in the publications in the communications domain.\n\nW: The authors do not extensively study the reasons behind the good performance of the NeuralEQ nor they discuss how the resulting NeuralEQ is different from the Forward-Backward algorithm, from which it is motivated. It is clearly different since it has lower complexity in many cases. Is it because of some assumptions in the Forward-Backward algorithm are wrong?\n\nW: The authors do not discuss the training and validation data split in detail. The training and validation data should be described in detail in every setting. \n\nW: How general is the trained algorithm? Does the algorithm need to be retrained if something in the transmission path changes? What are the typical changes? How often in real life would this happen?\n\nW: How representative are the simulations to the real world? Since all results are produced by simulations, the authors should cite previous works that have compared similar simulations to real channels. The best option would of course be to record real data and validate the simulation trained algorithm on real data.\n\n\nMinor weaknesses and comments:\n\n\u2014---------------------\n\nAbstract: \u201cRapid growth of ML applications demands high-performance computing systems\nto perform massive data processing.\u201d, I don\u2019t think ML applications are the only ones that require high bandwith, e.g., video applications is pretty large.\n\nMinor spelling mistakes:\n\nHeader 4: \u201cEXPERMIENT RESULTS\u201d -> EXPERIMENT RESULTS \n\n4.2 \u201cNerualEQ\u201d -> NeuralEQ \n\nFigure 4: \u201cpruning increase\nthe performance of NeuralEQ.\u201d \ud83e\udc6a \u2026 pruning increases the performance of NeuralEQ\n",
