The design of the model continues the ideas from IODINE, which iteratively inference latent representations to generative target images. Differently, the global features and relational features are designed to be separated and learned implicitly. The model is evaluated on two downstream tasks: planning and casual understanding, experiments show the effectiveness of the disentangled representation.",

The authors do a good job explaining the model.\n\nWeakness:\n- Equation one \\sigma has a (0) superscript, which seems to be a typo.\n- I think overall, the downstream task evaluation seems a bit underwhelming to me.\n1. I think the evaluation metrics and visualizations are not exactly informative. As far as I can tell from the paper, the action and measurements are done in 3D. The evaluation metrics of accuracy is based off a distance metric that's unspecified in the paper and appendix. Not showing direct measurement in 3D limits my confidence in the model. MSE is calcuated in pixel space, which is weird, because say we move the cube along the camera direction, it results in not so much change in pixel mse, but the 3D location can be far off.\n2. From what I can tell, OP3 seems like a model from quite awhile ago, while STOVE seems to be a very relevant baseline. I can't really tell from the paper which reference is STOVE, and why the authors are not comparing with it.",

Prior work also demonstrates such disentangled representation even without explicit modeling of the dynamic and static features. Without further quantitative comparison with other baselines or in more complex scenarios, it\u2019s hard to justify the significance of the proposed model. 2) The downstream experiments are mainly compared against OP3, which does not disambiguate global or relational features. Are there justifications why not compare to factorized models like STOVE?\n",

The proposed method is based on OP3, but with a formulation that encourages the desired disentanglement. In experiments, the authors show that the interaction-relevant and interaction-irrelevant latent variables are in fact disentangled by swapping them between two different sequences. They also show that the disentangled representations lead to improved performance in downstream tasks against the baselines.",

However, I am not clear how the authors are able to get locations from the latents, and so, can't really see how this evaluation is possible. Can the authors clarify how this is done? Or point out where in the paper this is described. If this is in fact somewhere in the paper, and I cannot find it, it would be useful if this is revised later on so it's easier to find.\n\n\n\n- Pairwise interactions mechanism visualizations:\nIn page 5, the authors mention that they use a d_{o,o} function to calculate pairwise interactions between objects. However, there is no analysis of how these interactions are happening after a model is trained. If this is possible, it would be good to have some type of visualization showing how these become active when objects are interacting in the pixel space.\n\n\n\n- Typos in the writing:\nThere are many typos throughout the text. For example, in section 3.2, first paragraph, line 7, module is misspelled as moduele. In addition, there is misuse of the verb is. For example, in page 6, 4th paragraph, the authors say \"Finally, parameters of a generative model p\u03b8 and an inference model q\u03c6 is\" while it should be \"Finally, parameters of a generative model p\u03b8 and an inference model q\u03c6 are\". These type of typos are happening in multiple places in the manuscript. I suggest the authors proof read the manuscript and fix these writing issues.",
