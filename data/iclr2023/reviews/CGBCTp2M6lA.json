            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors proposed to leverage future relationships for vehicle trajectory prediction. Particularly, the method first predicts future waypoint occupancy on lane segments. Then, a future relationship module defines an interaction edge between every two agents based on the proximity and features of the two agents, and the interaction edges follow Gaussian mixture distributions. Conditioned on the interaction features and intention features, the decoder predicts the trajectory. The results is SoTA on nuScenes dataset and on par to SoTA on Argoverse dataset.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1. Compared with previous methods which directly use the history to predict the future, this method add an intermediate step, which first predict future waypoint occupancy on lane segments, and then derive explicit future relationships between agents. The paper show that such explicit future relationships are very helpful for predicting the final trajectory of an agent, and the model achieve SoTA results on nuScenes dataset.\n\n2. To derive future relationship, the authors proposed to calculate inter-agent pair-wise feature vectors that follow Gaussian Mixture distributions, and ablation study shows that modeling the stochastic of this feature vector is important.\n\nTherefore, this paper has good methodological contribution. Meanwhile, the experiments are thorough with quantitative, qualitative and ablation results.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The authors should really work on simplifying the notations. There are too many sup- and subscript and it is hard to follow.\n\n2. Why is the waypoint occupancy conditioned on the sampled goal lane features? Can we integrate out the goal? The Gaussian Mixture  in FRM should be able to capture the stochasticity of goals. This will reduce inference time.\n\n3. In section 4.4, the authors says \"the goal feature (\\hat{h}^{-}_{\\ell})\" is sampled F times from the inferred waypoint occupancy, however, in section 4.1 the waypoint occupancy is derived from the goal feature. The two statements seem contradictory.\n\n4. z_{e}^{ij} in equation (7) already contains information about h_x^j, why do we need another element-wise product with h_x^j? Does experiment show that this is necessary?\n\n5. Why is the Argoverse test set results not included in Table 3?\n\n6. The method does introduce quite a lot of computation compared with other baselines such as MultiPath++. It would be better if the authors can report training and inference cost compared with baselines. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Problem: Vehicle Trajectory Prediction as commonly defined and evaluated.\n\nKey insight: agents usually follow lanes, so explicitly use lane graph structure to find likely future agent-agent interactions.\n\nNovel contributions: Future Relationship Module that consumes waypoint occupancy estimates + lane graph and produces a prior distribution of interactions conditioned on the historical trajectory, trained against a posterior distribution conditioned on the full trajectory for training. Ablations show that this module is the key to system performance, as without it performance deteriorates to baseline which only uses historical trajectories.\n\nEvaluation: competitive / SotA performance on standard metrics for popular public Trajectory Prediction benchmarks (NuScenes and Argoverse 1)\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: Good performance on popular public Trajectory Prediction benchmarks (NuScenes and Argoverse 1). The novel contribution, the Future Relationship Module, is shown to benefit the performance of the network. Furthermore, Future Relationships Module appears to provide useful features that are orthogonal to the modules of other competitive methods, opening up the possibility of future work that combines these methods together.\n\nWeaknesses: Paper's actualized key insight is \"agents usually follow lanes\" but they do not do any analysis to show how often this assumption is violated. Due to the fact that the method performs well, presumably it's not very often, but it would be nice to know often it emerges in the train/val dataset and qualitatively what happens to the predictions under these conditions.\n\nNuScenes results not fully SotA due to missing models (https://www.nuscenes.org/prediction?externalData=all&mapData=all&modalities=Any). DGCN_ST_LANE has significantly lower MinADE_5 (1.092) vs the proposed method (1.19 as reported in the paper), a gap larger than reported against the runner up PGP, and DGCN_ST_LANE was submitted on May 25th 2022, which is significantly before the Sept 28 2022 ICLR submission deadline and thus should be mentioned in the results table. However, note that the authors' proposed method *does* outperform DGCN_ST_LANE on MinADE_10 (0.89 in the paper vs 0.974) and so it does maintain some claim to SotA.\n\nArgoverse 1 results were reported on the *validation* set, not the test set on the public leaderboard. This important to note because the proposed method is outperformed on the validation set by HiVT. HiVT performs significantly worse on the test set -- HiVT-128, the method described in Zhou et al., 2022, has significant hits to both mADE_6 (0.66 val vs 0.77 test) and mFDE_6 (0.96 val vs 1.17 test), and is outperformed on this test set by many methods such as DCMS (Ye et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05859, posted April 12th, 2022) Wayformer (Nayakanti et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05844, posted July 12, 2022). Certainly the transitive performance degradation from the Argoverse 1 validation set to test set of HiVT may not apply to the authors' method, but this does leave a lingering question of how well the proposed method actually stacks up relative to the state of the art.

Furthermore, the English is choppy and sometimes grammatically incorrect -- the content is still intelligible, but it's often mildly distracting.\n\nTo the authors, I would recommend:\n1) read through where all your variables are defined relative to figures and make sure that there's no more than ~1 page between their use and definitions\n2) using an easily accessible English-based LLM e.g. GPT-3 from OpenAI, one paragraph at a time paste in your existing text and ask it to edit the text for grammar and clarity; this should be an easy way to clean up the text with little work on your end.\n3) highlight in the conclusion that your Future Relationship Module is compatible with other SotA trajectory prediction methods and future work of combining them together will likely result in an even stronger method!",
