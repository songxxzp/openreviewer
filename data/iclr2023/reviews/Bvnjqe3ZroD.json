            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The concept of applying a PCA-like analysis to zero-sum games is very intriguing and, to my knowledge, novel. The method presented is simple yet powerful, and creates very interesting analyses of games. I think this is a good contribution to the literature, and as such I vote to accept.\n\nOne potential avenue of improvement is to include explicitly-worked decompositions of simple zero-sum games. For example, what is the decomposition of generalized RPS (i.e., 2k+1 actions of each player; action i beats action j if (i-j) mod (2k+1) <= k) or generalized matching pennies (normal-form game, n actions per player, payoff = identity matrix)? (of course, properly symmetrized.) That may give some intuition for what the method is doing--for example, we know exactly what the equilibria should be in both cases (uniform random).\n\nI have only a few minor questions:\n\n1. Why decompose $F_c$ instead of directly decomposing $F$ itself? That is, why ever explicitly separate out the transitive component? The decomposition could also be used on $F$ itself, and the transitive component would naturally appear as a component of the decomposition if it is prominent enough. This is what happened in the Pokemon example, and it produced a nice-looking plot of the transitive component. It would be interesting, in my opinion, to see that component explicitly in the Blotto example.\n\n1. Does this method have any implications for *solving* games? For example, if a straightforward method exists to solve games with low rank, one could apply that method to a low-rank approximation of a game that is otherwise too complex to be solved, and hopefully recover a good strategy in that game as well. \n\n1. How dependent are the embeddings $\\vec y_k(i)$ on the particular choice of (low-dimensional) embedding of the strategy space? For example, in the example Blotto game, one could hypothetically simply represent each pure strategy $i$ as a basis vector $\\vec e_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2926}$. Would that result in different visualizations? How different?\n\nPost-response: Thank you for the detailed response. I thought before that this was a strong paper, and I still do. I maintain my score.\n",

Furthermore truncation to the first planes provides a meaningful reduction of the game. The authors illustrate the usefulness of the method on two games Blotto and Pokemon. In particular in  Blotto allows to recover specific symmetries whereas in Pokemon PTA recovers clusters that naturally correspond to Pokemon\ntypes and correctly identifies a strategic trade-off in the Pokemon generation type.",

And in particular the provided decomposition method is a valuable contribution. But the paper lacks of clarity in order to fully present the PTA method. In particular I find the presentation a bit too verbose and it could be improved with supporting precise quantitative statement and definition of the introduced quantities. It would be also useful to illustrate the different visual properties on a very simple example before jumping to the Blotto and Pokemon games. Finally the literature section could be improve by explaining what are the other methods of reductions, compare them to PTA in the experimental section.\n\n\n#Specific comments:\n\n- P2, related work: It is not very clear at this point what are the other methods and what are the differences between them and PTA.\n\n- P3, Section 3.1: Can you detail the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition and precise what is 'least squares ratings that evaluate the average performance of each agent'.\n\n- P3, Section 3.1: Often we do not have access to the exact advantage F but rather samples, how does you  model can be adapted to this case?\n\n- P3 Section 4: 'Each pair of consecutive columns' of which matrix?\n\n- P3, Section 4: define SVD.\n\n- P3, Section 4: It'll be easier to follow if you define precisely what are F_t and F_c.\n\n- P3, (2): Ok but you already used the notations Q and U for the decomposition of F when you said you replaced A by F.\n\n- P3 below (2):  Can you define what is the optimal rank 2r approximation for F_c.\n\n- P4, Section 4: Actually you never defined properly what is PTA.\n\n- P4, above (4): Add a comma for the lower index of F_{c,i,j}.\n\n- P4, last paragraphs: Can you  details these properties quantitatively?\n\n- P5, last paragraph: How do you get discrete allocation from the sample of a Dirichlet?\n\n- P6, Blotto Example 1: At this point it is hard to understand Table 1, especially since some notations used in it are still not introduced.\n\n- P6: What is exactly a trade-off? Is it the same thing as a disc-game?\n\n- P6, exchange symmetry: I'm not sure I follow this part. Why such subtlety is not  treated in the previous section presenting PTA? And since generic games should not exhibit such strong symmetries why choosing this game as first example?\n\n- P7 Second paragraph: At this point it is not completely clear for me what you plot in Figure 1. Can you detail precisely which quantity in function of what is plotted.\n\n- P8, Section 5.2: What are the agents in this case?",
