            "summary_of_the_paper": "This work proposes to use a specific structure in the latent space of conditional VAEs used for multi-agent time-series prediction. In particular, the paper argues that the existing use of graph neural nets to capture social dependence between agents for predicting future states contains a lot of redundancies due to the fully-connected nature of the assumed underlying graph. To that end, a latent structure is proposed where at each time step first a node/edge labeling of the fully-connected graph of agents is attained, and then the labels are used to select the parameters of the decoder/prior/encoder that are conditioned on the graph, thereby selecting a particular choice among a discrete set of latent graph structures when computing the final state predictions at each time step. The experiments show improvements in time-series prediction of two team sports (soccer and basketball dynamics) over existing methods, as well as some evidence for learning a sensible latent graph structure.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n\nThe paper aims to solve an interesting problem with clear applications, and sets up the problem well. The design choices are sufficiently explained (though an ablation study would be nice to verify some of the intuitions).\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nI have the following concerns regarding the validity of the contributions:\n\n1) The method uses the fully-connected graph structure to infer the discrete latents (agents and type interactions), which are then used to infer the graph structure used for time-series prediction at each step. However, if you are going to use the fully-connected graph as a latent to your latent, why not directly use it as the latent as in GVRNN? To elaborate more, the main contribution of this work in my view is to place a structure on the fully-connected latent graph (since existing works like GVRNN already incorporate the fully-connected latent graph), but if you are going to use the fully-connected graph to learn this additional structure, this seems to essentially defeat the purpose: you are using the fully-connected graph as part of your latent anyways!\n\n2) Since the proposed model is larger (more complex) compared to baselines due to having a set of graphs to choose from instead of a single one (more concretely, the functions involved in encoding/decoding use a discrete set of parameters), how can we be sure that any improvement is not merely due to this increase in complexity? In other words, does simply using \u201clarger\u201d decoders/encoder/priors achieve the same results as your proposed model?\n\n3) I don\u2019t see how the results in Tables 1 and 2 support this statement on page 7: \u201cThe empirical results suggest that our proposed modeling strategy effectively both eliminates interfering social signals and discriminates between different agent and interaction types so that future agent movements can be captured more accurately.\u201d\n\n4) None of the reported results show error bars, so it is not clear if the average improvements upon baselines are statistically significant.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper does not read well in my opinion, for two reasons in particular: First, several statements are somewhat open-ended and confusing to me such as: \u201cThe architecture draws on insights from neural interaction learning to allocate all latent information into the intended variables\u201d, \u201cvia attaching latent variables to individual agents, their respective representative capacity is governed by the cardinality of the agent set. Hence, the complexity of information inherent in larger multi-agent systems can be accounted for in a natural way\u201d \u2013 making the claims more specific and substantial would greatly help this. Second, important details of the implementation (which clarifies a lot of the actual contribution) is move to the appendix (B1 and B2 should be in the main body in my opinion, which also contain under-explained statements such as \u201cusing samples from the encoder and ground-truth\u201d \u2013 need to be more specific about \u201cusing\u201d \u2013 and similarly when explaining the inference time).\n\nThe quality is lacking in terms of not providing error bars for experiments.\n\nThe work seems somewhat novel to me, as I have not seen this particular structure placed on the latent graph, and setting up this structure and making it train successfully does have merit. But I\u2019m not convinced that the structure is useful, I would like to see some experiments directly comparing the importance of structure vs. larger latent capacity. The setup seems mostly reproducible, but the number of channel dimensions, K, and M seem missing.\n\n**Typos**\n\nPage 2: i index missing in definition of D.\n\nPage 4: it is natural is to\n\nB.1: a vectorial representation\n\nB.2: multiagent sequence",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper targets an interesting problem: placing a structure on the latent graph for multi-agent time-series prediction; but it lacks clarity in its writing, and its experiments are not convincing as detailed above.\n\n---\n### Post-rebuttal update\nI thank the authors for addressing my concerns. I've raised my score to 5 since the paper now reads better and includes experiments clarifying the importance of the added latent structure. However, since results still lack error bars (all except the new figure), and also it is not explained how the error bars are obtained, I cannot be sure of the significance of the contributions. Nonetheless, I think the paper's main idea is valuable and interesting, and I encourage the authors to rewrite the paper with more focus on statistically robust and well-explained comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.\n",

The alternate perspective on the objective function in the Appendix is insightful \n\n## Weaknesses\n\n### 1\\. Literature Review\n\nThe paper regrettably fails to acknowledge a vast body of related literature, on (i) intention-conditioned trajectory prediction, (ii) variational graph methods for trajectory prediction, and (iii) models that explicitly model social interactions for forecasting. At the very least, these references ought to be mentioned and discussed for a diligent representation of the research space, even if the methods are not directly compared against. \n\n(i) **Intention-Conditioned Trajectory Prediction**:\n\n[R1, R2, R3] talk about intention-conditioned trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. Apart from the data the methods are applied to, the architectures can be applicable to, and are relevant for, the problem being addressed here. Crucially, the DROGON paper defines intention explicitly (more on this in Weakness 2. below). \n\n(ii) **Variational Graph Methods**:\n\n[R4] from the Neurips I Can't Believe It's Not Better Workshop explicitly deals with graph conditional variational methods for multi-agent trajectory prediction. The results in that paper are very relevant for this research area and should be included. \n\n(iii) **Encoding Social Interactions**:\n\nGraph and other stochastic methods that encode social interactions between agents have been long applied to trajectory and behavior forecasating problems. [R5] explicitly incorporates a spatiotemporal graph for incorporating social interactions between agents. [R6] more recently explicitly takes a meta-learning approach for modeling the dynamics unique to a group for probabilistic forecasting. A sports team is a group, and if each team is viewed as having unique social dynamics resulting from the team's strategy then [R6]'s core modeling idea is directly applicable. The cue in [R6] terms is simply player location here. Their modeling of social influence of other agents is also permutation invariant, a limitation this paper claims about existing methods. \n\n#### References:\n\n[R1] DROGON: A Trajectory Prediction Model based on Intention-Conditioned Behavior Reasoning - Choi et al. \n\n[R2] Intention-Driven Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving - Fan et al. \n\n[R3] LOKI: Long Term and Key Intentions for Trajectory Prediction - Girase et al. \n\n[R4] Graph Conditional Variational Models: Too Complex for Multiagent Trajectories? - Rudolph et al. \n\n[R5] Social-STGCNN: A Social Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Human Trajectory Prediction - Mohamed et al. \n\n[R6] Social Processes: Self-Supervised Meta-Learning over Conversational Groups for Forecasting Nonverbal Social Cues - Raman et al.\n\n### 2\\. Unsupported claims and definitions\n\nThe paper doesn't actually define agent intentions and causality in the specific setting, so there is no reasonable way to evaluate whether the proposed method actually models intentions. The intention-conditioned trajectory works I've mentioned talk about intention over long- and short- time horizons, where e.g. the former is in terms of goal destinations. Here the paper is talking about team sports with player intentions but simply states that this results from communication. What does intention mean here? Also, the paper claims to model causal relationships, but I can't see any explicit causal factors modeled of learned in the graph structure. There might be other exogenous variables explaining trajectory behavior.\n\n### 3\\. Notation\n\nThere are a few notational errors. For instance, the variable used for the sequence cannot be the same as the individual elements: $x_{<t} = [x_1, ...]$. See [R4] for this. In many places there exist grammatical errors and incomplete sentences. Please do a pass to fix these. ",

There are some broad overclaims in terms of modeling intention or causality, neither of which are clearly defined in context, which is a crucial problem \n\n* Quality: The quality can significantly be improved through a  principled grounding of the previously mentioned factors in a fairer and more complete review of the relevant literature, some of which I have linked to in the previous section. \n\n* Novelty: The novelty is limited; as mentioned, conditioning on intentions, incorporating variational graph structures, and modeling social interactions between agents has been done for trajectory and general cue forecasting. This does not prevent an important contribution in this space by itself, but the paper does not explicitly provide one by diligently defining and modeling the factors they claim to do. \n\n* Reproducibility: The paper provides implementation details in the Appendix that is useful for reproducibiliy",
