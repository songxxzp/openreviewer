It would be better to also discuss and compare such kind of methods.\n\n(2) While traditional data augmentation methods can be considered as perturbations on image level, there lacks a discussion and comparison on why feature-level perturbation should be better than image-level augmentation to enlarge the diversity of the training data.\n\n(3) It is not very convincing that object detection is hard to be trained with multiple source domains, as even in public domains there are already several datasets with different styles. While it is an advantage that the proposed method only relies on one single source domain for training, it would still be interesting to see experimental comparisons with all methods trained on multiple domains to see the difference.\n\n(4) There are a few other generalizable object detection studies which are not reviewed in the paper, such as:\n\nLin et al.

Enables training models on cityscape to generalize well on Foggy Cityscapes and BDD 100K.\n\nWeakness\n- I tend to think that the way of increasing model robustness proposed in this paper is not designed for the object detection task. This is because the approach is a style transformation of image-level features, but ignores box-level features. \n- The classwise mAP is not listed in the paper, so it is not clear whether NP could enhance detectors to be robust to all categories.\n- I question the value of this style synthesize method NP for application in object detectors, whether it can be added to a model that already has strong augment and still have large gains, for example, whether it can be added to the current SOTA detectors with strong augment, like dino or Yolo v6.\n- Whether this approach will interfere with other data enhancement methods designed for detection tasks, such as InstaBoost.

But it maybe worth trying to add image augmentation to increase the variance of the training data.\n* The proposed method seems to be restricted to autonomous driving datasets. Although they may have different style (e.g. weather/time of day) across different domains, the variance between them are still small.
