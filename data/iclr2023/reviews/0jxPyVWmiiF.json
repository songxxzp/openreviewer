            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this work, the authors propose an efficient single-loop iterative procedure to compute the Gromov Wasserstein (GW) distance between two sets. The GW distance can be formulated as a quadratic programming with a doubly-stochastic constraint. Many of the existing approaches for solving this optimization are double loop in nature, which involve solving another expensive sub-problem iteratively within a single iteration. In the proposed algorithm BAPG, a Bregman alternating projection step is performed with respect to the row and column stochastic constraints in each iteration. By alternatively projecting to polytopes with only row or column constraints, the projection attains a closed form update, thus attaining computational efficiency compared with other algorithms. For a theoretical understanding of the proposed algorithm BAPG, it has been shown that (1) BAPG converges to a fixed point asymptotically and (2) the distance between a fixed point of BAPG and the set of critical points of the original GW problem can be bounded, which is inversely proportional to the penalty parameter. The authors evaluate the algorithm on both synthetic and real datasets related to graph alignment and partition, and demonstrate the solution quality as well as the time efficiency.",

The Luo-Tseng error bound is utilized to establish the distance between the fixed point of the algorithm and the critical set of the original GW problem. A few minor things in terms of technicality: (1) the algorithm itself is not stated with splitting, e.g., a single variable $\\pi$ for the update; but the analysis uses two variables. Can the connection be explicitly stated in the main text? (2) Since the BAPG only returns a solution that is close to the critical set of the GW. Could it happen that some critical point has much worse value than the global min of the GW problem? (3) BAPG returns an infeasible solution in many cases. What if we want to return a feasible solution? ",

For instance: \n   - does Eq. (9) enables to get a convergence rate toward the fixed-point $(\\pi^\\star, w^\\star)$? (if so, and provided a rounding scheme is valid there (see below), I think this would yield an overall approximation-rate for GW which may be of interest and could be compared with other benchmarks).\n    - Why is it clear that a limit point $(\\pi^\\infty, w^\\infty)$ exists? I guess this follow from some compactness arguments (i.e. the sequence shall be bounded thanks to $f$ being coercive), but this is not striking in the proof as far as I can tell.  \n- [More a suggestion than a weakness] Experimental evaluation could be slightly extended as they suggest some interesting behavior. In particular, in the light of Fig 2. (b), it seems there is a (natural) tradeoff between convergence speed and the infeasibility error wrt the parameter $\\rho$, so a possibly useful idea would be to start with a fairly high $\\rho$ and progressively reduce it (as a sort of warm start). \n- I think some references are missing, in particular the work of _The unbalanced Gromov Wasserstein distance: Conic formulation and relaxation_ by S\u00e9journ\u00e9 et al., 2021, which introduces a similar relaxation of the GW problem, and proves under specific condition that minimizers of $(\\pi, w) \\mapsto F(\\pi,w)$ are the same as those of $\\pi \\mapsto F(\\pi,\\pi)$. \n\n## Other remarks/questions/suggestion\n- If my understanding is correct, the output of BAPG is (approximately) a plan of the form $(\\pi^\\star + w^\\star)/2$, which, if I am correct, does not exactly have the expected marginals $(\\mu,\\nu)$. Assuming this would be critical, could someone apply a `rounding` scheme in the vein of [Altschuler et al., 2018] ? \n- [suggestion for clarity] I think that in propositions statements, it may serve clarity to add quantifers \"$\\forall x,y$\", or \"$\\forall \\pi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$, and so on, to make clear on which parameter does the constant $M,\\tau_1,\\tau_2$ depend (or not). \n- [typo] In Remark 3.7, the ref to prop 3.4 should be 3.5 I think. \n- [typo] In proof of prop 3.1, $D_x$ should be $D_X$.

In particular, they provide an approximation bound for the distance between the fixed-point set of BAPG method and the critical point set of GW. Their analysis is based on the observation that the GW problem satisfies a so-called Luo-Tseng error bound condition, and the authors claim that they are the first to incorporate this idea in the GW literature. The paper complements their theoretical analysis with a few experiments comparing the performance of BAPG and other algorithms on graph alignment and partition tasks.

Moreover, there does not seem to be sufficient empirical evidence to support their claim. If the infeasibility does not matter at all, does that mean the graph tasks can be potentially solved using an easier formulation (i.e., one that does not require solving an GW problem)? This seems to suggest that the experiments chosen are unsuitable for the purpose of comparing the relative strength of GW algorithms.
