I am sure the suggested Planckian-based augmentation is useful for a few applications that suffer from light color changes. However, I am not sure the importance of this in general settings. The existing common color augmentation is still needed for general applications (those that are not much affected by light colors, but suffer from the limited training data). Hence, proposing only the Planckian augmentation in a whole paper is too narrow and too little in terms of the contribution. \n\n2. A quick search on the internet shows there are a few papers proposing different color augmentation techniques for certain applications: PCA Color Augmentation, \"Data-Driven Color Augmentation Techniques for Deep Skin Image Analysis\", \"A New Color Augmentation Method for Deep Learning Segmentation of Histological Images\".

However, in the daily life, we capture image under various lights, such as LED light and other daylight D55 and so on.\n- The improvement of proposed method is not significant in some cases. According to Table 1, the proposed Planckian Jitter performs significantly worse than default color jitter on CIFAR-100 dataset. Besides, Planckian Jitter without brightness and contrast (B&C) or Planckian-based chromaticity performs even worse than without data augmentation. \n- The compared methods are not comprehensive. The proposed Planckian Jitter mainly performs on SimSiam (2021), and generally performs on SimCLR (2020) and Barlow Twins (2021). It is better to perform on more recently proposed contrastive learning methods. Besides, the goal of color data augmentation is to improve the performance of image classification network. Thus, why not directly perform the proposed method on advanced image classification network, such as ResNet-101, Swin-Transformer and so on.\n- The selection of some parameters is difficult to understand, such as C_B, C_C in Equation 5.

In particular, they compare the traditional random color augmentation strategy with a color augmentation based on simulating changing illuminants. The illuminants used are drawn from the distribution of Planckian illuminants. The authors train the network in an unsupervised manner to learn an embedding space and then build a linear classifier using the embedding to test the effectiveness of the embedding on two standard data sets. Using a combined embedding that makes use of a network trained using the traditional color augmentation and a network trained using the Planckian color augmentation provides the best performance.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The strength of the paper is the intentional analysis of the color augmentation process used in deep network training. In particular, the author's hypothesize that the standard color augmentation process strongly reduces color as a useful feature for classification. While for some objects, color is not strongly indicative (though certain distributions may be), for other tasks, such as natural objects like flowers and birds, color may be a critical feature. The improved performance on the flowers database appears to support this hypothesis. Likewise, the evaluation on two other data sets shows that the embedding trained with the Planckian illuminants is robust across simulated illumination changes, while the embedding trained with traditional color augmentation is not.\n\nThere are other potential illuminants besides Planckian, but for the purpose of analyzing this question, it is a reasonable model to choose.\n\nThis is only a first step towards appropriate training using color augmentation. The whole image augmentation model means that there is no selectivity by surface or current illumination conditions. An object in shadow, for example, is in a different lighting condition than the same object that is fully lit, and simulating the spectral rotation of a new direct illuminant shouldn't actually modify the shadowed areas as  much or at all.  Likewise, there is still a need for color augmentation of objects for which color is not discriminative.  However, the use of the combined embedding acknowledges that. It could be more explicit in the paper that there are several valid types of color augmentation, and that whole image color augmentation is a pretty heavy hammer compared to an ideal selective augmentation process.\n\nGiven the need to train two separate embeddings, one for each type of jitter, how does this get implemented in standard network architectures?  Does it have utility beyond this particular network structure?",
