            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper discusses a solution for communication in multi-agent learning in terms of message size (and implicitly when to transmit). The paper is evaluated by means of an environment developed by the authors, which is based on a classification task of the MNIST dataset based on partial views of the images themselves. Each agent \"decides\" which information is sent to the others in order to execute the classification task end-to-end.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This is an interesting paper about a problem of general applicability. The main concern is that the problem itself is evaluated in a very specific environment. The main novelty of the work resides probably in framing the general problem of learning the type of messages exchanged by the agents in presence of noise. The actual solution per se is rather standard (end-to-end training with local encoders that generate messages that are exchanged among a group of agents in order to execute a task).\nMore specifically, the reviewer wonders if the actual task used for the evaluation might have a strong impact on the results. In fact, at the end, the local \"encoding\" might be seen as a problem of classification. Each agent \"encodes\" the most probable \"digits\" that are present in the image and then this is used for the overall classification. There might be different types of encoding given different available sizes. From the results presented by the authors, there is a minimal amount of information that is necessary to transmit. The problem of traffic in this case can be framed as communication over a noisy channel, but then, again, a \"trivial\" solution might be to have a sufficient amount of information sent. It would be interesting to see what happens when just one or two agents transmit their messages, just to check if the results are independent from the fact that all (or most of) the agents are involved. Having said that, I think that the authors present an interesting set up for testing their model. The question is if it is possible to have sufficient evidence using only that environment in terms of validation. Probably different tasks that are not related to classification are necessary for a full-evaluation of this work. This is quite important, since the solution is evaluated only experimentally.\n\nThere is also a question about the message that is sent - the actual selection of the size of the message should be clarified in the paper.\n\nThere is also a question about which actual component has the strongest influence/impact on the obtained results. I understand that this is kind of lost in an end-to-end training, but I think it is a really important aspect. It seems that the size is important, but probably mostly importantly the encoding efficiency (given the probability of transmission error ) is also a key factor.\n\nIn general, the paper only briefly discusses the limitations of the proposed solution. A major limitation of the work appears to be the fact that the authors consider only one rather specific task (distributed image classification). It is quite difficult to generalize from the experimental results they present, even if they are valuable.\n\nOther open points about this paper are the following:\n\n- The reviewer wonders if the results we observe might be considered as strictly related to the problem/environment under consideration. How can you say that the results reported in the paper might be generalized to other environments?\n\n- What is the real impact of the encoding, etc. when you have redundancy in terms of information? It seems to me that this work applies to cases where every agent is essentially performing the same action. Is it possible to extend this work to situations in which the different agents are involved in different tasks and communication is needed for coordination?\n\n- An interesting aspect to investigate is the fact that you have overlapping \"states\" (different views of the image). Is it possible to say that this is not a factor contributing to the results presented in the paper or is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a reinforcement learning based approach to multi-agent communication over noisy or limited channels. Agents therefore adapt to share messages of varying lengths and content depending on the channel characteristics and the local environment. The approach is demonstrated on a partially observable version of MNIST (POMNIST) in which each agent is allowed access to a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive subset of the image, and on a traffic junction problem. The results illustrate the ability adapt to different characteristics of channels and successfully communicate to achieve shared goals. ",
