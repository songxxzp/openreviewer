This effect has been widely observed in practices. The main result of the paper is given in Theorem 3.1, that deduces a lower bound on the accuracy of KRR under assumptions (A) eigenvalues decay rate, 1) smoothness of kernel and 2) lower bound on the variance of noice.

Does the saturation effect disappear is we have zero noise? E.g. what changes if we set sigma=0 in numerical experiments of Section 4? From the bias-variance decomposition formula on page 4 it seems that the effect should disappear, because the variance term will disappear. Could you comment on that.",

The theoretical contribution is significant.\n\nHowever, I still have some concerns about the assumptions. The lower bound is obtained under different assumptions than the upper bound. The upper bound (prop 2.2) requires the distributions satisfying conditions (B') and (C), while the proposed lower bound (thm 3.1) requires Assumption 1 and 2. Thus I do not think this paper completely proves the conjecture since it is still unknown whether the proposed lower bound can be obtained under condition (B') and (C).\n\nI'm also confused about the assumptions on the noise. Notice that condition (C) assumes the momentum of the noise is upper bounded but Assumption 2 requires the noise to be non-vanishing. These two assumptions seem somewhat opposite. I hope the authors can provide a detailed discussion of the required assumptions.\n\nminors:\n\nLine 2 of thm 3.1: \"satisfies the that\" -> \"satisfies that\"",

When \\alpha=2, the smoothness is equal to the that of the kernel, and if \\alpha > 2, the prediction function is smoother than the used kernel.
