            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a method, EDAL, for scene graph generation with active learning. The paper combines an uncertainty-based and diversity-based active learning. The former utilizes evidential deep learning to estimate the relationship uncertainties and the diversity-based sampling is driven by image-level biases. The main idea is to utilize the evidential probability based cross entropy loss as a regularizer for relationship classification. This evidential probability is the second-order probability derived from the parameterized Dirichlet distribution. Additionally, diversity-based on context and image-level bias is incorporated.  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper aims to develop a hybrid approach utilizing both the uncertainty-based and diversity-based active learning for scene graph generation tasks. The paper utilizes evidential deep learning for its known property of being reliable specially in open-set problems. \nThey took inspiration from EDL originally aimed for open-set action recognition and modified it for relationship recognition. Essentially that is utilizing the evidential probability based cross entropy loss as a regularizer. This evidential probability is the second-order probability derived from the parameterized Dirichlet distribution. The hypothesis is that the cross-entropy loss based on evidential-probability prevents the overconfident predictions in open-set relationships without affecting the uncertainty estimates. This is an intended behavior specially because of sparse relationship triplet labels present in a scene. The experimental designs including baselines corresponding different sampling strategies are convincing. Fig 3 depicting mean Recall values with varying labeling budget is a valuable addition in this paper. It also shows that the improvement of mR values don't come at the cost of Recall values. \n\nFrom the visualizations, it also looks like the method generates more fine-grained (in the case of VG, they are tail classes) relations : e.g. On vs sitting on in Fig 4. I am curious about how the relative performance trends are for a labeling budget over 10% such as 20%-25%.  ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The figure captions need to be more descriptive, such as Fig 2. \nMinor things: Fig 4 title and subtitle aren't consistent. Not clear if the visualization outputs are from 3-rd or 5-th AL round of AL in the top-right section for each. \n\nThe main contribution is to aptly applying the EDL for uncertainty based AL and combining with diversity-based AL for SGG. \n\nThey have provided the code based on masked RCNN repo to substantiate reproducibility. Although I didn't try to run the code, but the structure of the code appears to be in accordance with the main contributions. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "As a structured representation, the scene graph bridges computer vision and natural language processing, and the scene graph generation task is vital for the CV community. However, The annotation process of the scene graph is very complex including bounding boxes, labels, and relationships, so it is necessary to explore how to ensure the robustness of the scene graph model with few annotations. The authors propose a new method based on active learning, which trains a robust SGG model with fewer data by fully exploiting informative samples in the dataset.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The positive aspects of the paper include:\n\n1. Using the active learning method to save the annotation cost is a novel direction in scene graph generation and is important for further SGG study.\n\n2. The designs of the proposed modules, i.e., EDL, RPG, CBM, and IBM, are convincing and fully consider the inherent problems of SGG, such as data bias and sparsity of the dataset.\n\n3. The final performance of the proposed method is good, which approaches the performance of a fully supervised SGG model with only about 10% annotation cost for training the SGG model. The abundant ablation studies and detailed comparisons verified the effectiveness of the proposed modules.\n\nThere are some main concerns:\n\n1. As stated in the abstract, the authors aim to reduce the annotation cost. However, the proposed method only reduces the training set for training models, and the method also needs a large labeled dataset to sample an informative training set. Does this approach really save annotation costs throughout data collecting and model training processes?\n\n2. In section 3.1.1, the authors mentioned that \u201cthe uncertainty of xi can be estimated via evidential uncertainty ui = k/Si with a maximum value of 1.\u201d Why is the maximum value 1? Is eij greater than or equal to 0? The definition of eij is unclear.\n\n3. The authors should explain the qualitative results in Figure 4 in Section 4.2. What the figure illustrates? \n\nSome minor issues:\n\n1. Inconsistent symbol in Eq.(1) and following text. \u201cS\u201d (standardized) in Eq.(1) and \u201cS\u201d (italic) in text.\n\n2.
