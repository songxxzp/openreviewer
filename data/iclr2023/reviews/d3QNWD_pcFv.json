            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes the Lagrangian Schrodinger bridge (LSB) problem, a framework to recover the population dynamics from temporal data. LSB is a stochastic optimal control problem, which enables the authors to leverage the structure and propose the training objective (7). This method is evaluated on synthetic and single-cell population datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\nThe proposed framework is quite flexible. Moreover, it is simple, and it seems to work in experiments. The application of sing-cell population dynamics is interesting.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe major issue of the paper for me is that the contributions of the submission are not clear: \n- The objective (7) is not really new. The idea of relaxing the endpoint constraint by a softer one ($\\mathcal{W}_2$ in (7)) was exploited by the prior work of Lavenant et al. 2021 in a similar context, although without the neural SDE; the authors seem have missed this reference. The idea of incorporating the Hamiltonian term (9) was also present in existing literature (Yang & Karniadakis 2020). As for the Lagrangian term $\\mathcal{R}_e$, the authors simply reuse the regularization of Tong et al. 2020 without designing new ones.\n\n- There is also little contribution from the algorithmic side, since the authors essentially combined various known methods to treat each term separately in (7). \n\n- I'm not sure why the authors mentioned various SB related training but did not compare to them in the experiments. For instance, what is IPML (NN) in Table 1? Is it from Vargas et al. 2021 or De Bortoli et al. 2021? Is there any reason of including these methods, instead of, say, Chen et al. 2021a?\n\n- The $\\mathcal{W}_2$ in the proposed objective (7) suddenly turns into the entropy-regularized $\\mathcal{W}_\\epsilon$ in (11). Why not propose $\\mathcal{W}_\\epsilon$ to begin with?\n\n-----\nReference\nLavenant et al. 2021, Towards a mathematical theory of trajectory inference.",

            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper proposed an interesting framework for population dynamics. However, in its present state, it seems like gluing together several pieces (SB, stochastic optimal control, regularization from previous work, etc.) without any core contribution. I'm therefore inclined to rejection.\n\nI suggest the following improvements:\n\n1. Revise the presentation to highlight the contribution, focusing especially on the benefits of the neural SDE component in (6). \n\n2. Expand Section 3.3 to include more examples, even designing new ones, to reflect the generality of the proposed LSB. Otherwise, if the authors merely included one previous example (the cellular system), then the applicability of LSB is not really convincing to me.\n\n3. Since the theoretical contribution is fairly limited, the authors should perform more extensive experiments. In particular, for the single-cell population dynamics, the authors might consider including the dataset of Schiebinger et al. 2019. In addition, following the point above, experiments on more applications, instead of just synthetic and single-cell population dynamics, are recommended.",

Existing works have used Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) or schrodinger bridges (SBs) to tackle this problem. This work (NLSB) combines adhoc regularizations in Tong et al. 2020 and more recent SDE formulations to learn a principled and regularized SDE to model cell populations and incorporate additional regularizations. The method is tested on a synthetic OU SDE and a single-cell RNA-seq dataset measuring embryoid body development over time. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n- Clearly explained motivation formalizing previously adhoc regularizations in Tong et al. 2020\n- Adds ideas from cellular modeling to SDE and Schrodinger bridge models for improved modeling of a cellular system.\n- Good tradeoff of time vs. accuracy in figure 5 across dimensionalities.\n- Interesting architecture adaptation for fast gradient computation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- Limited evaluation (2 settings) with relatively minor improvements in performance.\n- The network is not as easy to invert as other models which use ODE dynamics (Tong et al. 2020) or train both a forward and backwards model. I see that a reverse time simulation was performed in E.4, but it is unclear to me how well this works in practice (quantitatively). I have had numerical difficulties training this backwards network in the past.\n\nComments / questions:\n\nThere is something strange in these comparisons\u2026 what are the differences with NeuralSDE?\n\nFigure 10, are the captions correct? It looks to me that (e) and (f) are switched.\n\n\u201cThe weight coefficients $\\lambda_e$ and $\\lambda_h$ are tuned for each interval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ respectively\u201d. Can the authors elaborate here? This seems concerning as there may be potential for data leakage.\n\nIt might be interesting to visualize the potential landscape (as is done in Bunne et al. 2022). Biologists are quite interested in what is termed \u201cWaddington\u2019s landscape\u201d for developing systems. \n\nWould it be possible to include an additional evaluation metric (besides the 2-Wasserstein distance)? The 2-Wasserstein distance mostly cares about outliers, that the distribution is \u201cmostly right\u201d which might miss some of the other differences between the predicted and true distributions. Common choices I believe are 1-Wasserstein distance (Tong et al. 2020, Vargas et al. 2021) and Maximum mean discrepancy (Huguet et al. 2022). Since you directly optimize for the 2-Wasserstein distance this may be an overoptimistic metric. If this is not possible it would at least be good to note the limitations of the current evaluation.",
