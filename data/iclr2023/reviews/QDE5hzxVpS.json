            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper argues based on prior work that the encoding of positional information from padding, abbreviated PPP by convolutional neural networks is an undesired property that can have unwanted side-effects. The degree to which PPP is learned as a consequence of different padding techniques is investigated and a new way to quantify it is proposed. In addition a new padding technique is explored, which could help to lower PPP.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n---------\n- Investigating PPP makes sense and the method proposed to do this is relatively simple.\n\n- The experiments are thorough and relatively large in scale showing clear results.\n\n- An ability to reliably quantify PPP is a requirement for further understanding of its consequences and possibly ways of mitigating its effects.\n\nWeaknesses\n----------\n- Some table and figure captions are lacking details and/or are confusing.\n  - Figure 1 is placed and referenced so early in the manuscript that it is hard to understand what it contains. E.g. what is the sampling process, how are the two signals generated, how is PP quantified? What is the right column in relation to the other four?\n  - I suggest you explain what the numbers indicate in table 1. Also this is a very large table with a lot of information that is only referenced once in text and in a single short sentence. Is all of this information really necessary?\n  - Table 2 is also relatively large, and I find it hard to deduce from the text what numbers should be compared and how this relates to the title in bold. Consider helping the reader a bit more.\n  - Table 3, here the caption seems a bit misleading. \"The results show a consistent and significant increment of PPP is developed through the model training\". Somehow this seems more fitting as a description of Figure 5, as table 3 seems to be about pretraining and it only compares pretraining with no pretraining.\n\n- As far as I understand Table 2 it shows the different possitional encoding measurement metrics (SPC, MAE, and PPP-MAE) for the different padding schemes and models. In section 4.2 it is concluded that because the standard deviations are larger than the differences between the padding variants, the PosENet based metrics cannot be used to say much about the benefits of these padding methods. While this may be true, as far as I can deduce, this does not necessarily indicate a problem with the PosENet based metrics, it may also just be the case that PPP varies a lot over training runs.\n\n- An intuitive explanation for the equations given (1, 2, and 3) would help understanding.\n\n Other smaller annoyances\n  - Consider avoiding the abbreviation of method names in the abstract or write what they are.\n  - \"Padding, one of the most fundamental components in neural network architectures, has received much less attention than other modules in the literature\", what do you mean by this? What is a module in this context?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- On clarity, despite the simplicity of the equations and the experiments conducted, I find the work relatively hard to read. More details is given under weaknesses.\n\n- On quality, despite its clarity issues, I like the work. The manuscript could be improved if the method was used to propose a padding technique that actually made a difference in terms of the investigated metrics.\n\n- On novelty, I don't find it particularly surprising that neural networks can and do learn to detect padded values in order to inform about locations. I also think the idea that the proposed randn padding scheme would alleviate this to be a long shot. It seems to me that in order to really be able to really match the distribution in the padded regions more advanced techniques are needed. One could imagine using adversarial learning or other methods for generating realistic image data. Despite this, the work is looking at a previously largely overlooked aspect of neural network architecture design choice and making meaningful contributions to quantifying how well these choices work.\n\n- On reproducibility, code and data collection scripts will be made available on acceptance, which would make it easier to reproduce.\n\n\n",

The proposed method seems to have lower variability than the other methods.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThis study did not discuss how the PPP affects CNNs in practice. The proposed padding did not compare against other commonly used paddings in vision application to show its efficacy, which is not convincing. The padding scheme designed in Section 2.4 is to weaken PPP detected by eq3, which is based on an optimal padding solution as shown in eq2. It is better to discuss why cropping from a bigger picture can be considered a theoretical optimal padding. Having more content(pixels) could (slightly)deliver more semantic information, but I do not think the information can be associated with PPP, and the proposed padding is also algorithmical solution.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The proposed padding strategy is sampling from a normal distribution which is learned within a sliding window, its novelty is limited.
