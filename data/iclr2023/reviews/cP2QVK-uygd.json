            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the ability of GNNs to solve linear programming problems.  It is quite systematic and proves that within a well defined class of GNNs, and given a set of LPs, there exist networks (with specified weights) which can distinguish pairs of LP problems within the set with different feasibility and objective values, and which can approximate the objective value.  The argument is that the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, which it is known that GNNs can perform, suffices for these tasks.  A simple experimental check is made.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: what looks like a general and solid foundational theorem is clearly presented, with a conceptually simple argument.\n\nWeaknesses: the results do not bound the size of the networks required and do not cover generalization, so are of only theoretical interest.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The authors claim that \"we established the first complete proof that GNN can universally represent a broad class of LPs\".\nI am not expert enough to be confident about this, but if so then this looks like a valuable foundational result.\nFurthermore the argument based on the WL test is conceptually very simple and relates to much previous work on GNNs.\n",

By extending existing results on GNNs\u2014namely the paper by Xu et al. 2019 which equates the separation power of GNNs with Weisfeiler\u2013Lehman isomorphism test (WL test), and the Generalized Stone-Weierstrass Theorem as in Azizian &\nLelarge 2021\u2014this paper shows that GNNs can separate and represent LP properties.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\nThe solution given to the problem is natural in hindsight, and the connection between LP graphs/properties and GNN/WL-test appear to be new. And GNN and LP are both important on their own.\n\nWeaknesses:\nThe task of learning different LP properties (feasibility, optimal value, and shortest optimal solution) by neural networks appears somewhat artificial, because there are much better tools out there (various LP solvers, including those used by this paper in the numerical experiments section) than neural networks for this task, and likely neural networks will never be remotely competitive (both in theory or in practice) for learning LP related properties, where a deep mathematical theory trumps neural networks and vast training data.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is well written and easy to follow. The examples given, such as the LP-Graph in Figure 1 on page 3 and the LP-Graphs indistinguishable by WL test in Figure 2 on page 8, are very illustrative.\n\nIn general, both the big picture and the technical details are explained well, complete with experimental validation.\n\nIn terms of novelty, the idea of connecting LP graph or properties with GNN or WL test appears to be new, and mathematically natural in hindsight.\n\nThe paper presented sufficient details so the experimental results should be reproducible.",
