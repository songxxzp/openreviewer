            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors study the problem of learning continuous-time dynamical systems using NNs. They focus on the Structured State Space Sequence model (S4) and on a particular matrix for initializing the SSM called a HiPPO matrix. They used Legender polynomials to explain the ability of the HiPPO scheme to capture long dependencies. Their analysis helps them derive new guidelines and variants of the method that lead to performance improvement on Long Range Arena and Path X.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: The paper is mostly well-written, and the English level is satisfactory. The paper provides a contribution to an important problem by analyzing a leading method in this field. The analysis also leads to practical improvements in several challenging tasks that require modeling long dependencies with NNs.\n\nWeakness: The paper is very busy with information, without much space for intuitive explanations of some of the results. I would move some plots to the appendix, and add a conclusion and expand on some of the explanations to add intuition to the reader",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is mostly clear, and the quality of the research is high. The authors provide some novelty with the new analysis and the new variations proposed to the HiPPO framework. The experiments are well explained, making the results reproducible. \n\nMinor:\nThe word sequence is missing in the first sentence of the introduction\n In 2.1, you mention a projection to N-dimensional space, so it may be worthwhile to specify the dimension of the matrices in Equations 2 and 3 for clarity.\n\nP4 an extra bracket appears after the inner product <p,q>\n\nP4 \u201cHiPPO called this\u201d - this sentence seems broken.\n\nWhy are there no bold methods in the first free columns in table 1? Isn\u2019t bold representing the leading method?\n\nIt would be better to add a conclusion and move one of the figures to the appendix.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall the paper is well-written and provides a nice contribution to the community. The HiPPO framework seems very promising, and the authors provide new analysis and new variations of the methods with Legender polynomials or Fourier Basis functions. This enables them to improve SOTA in several tasks.\nFor these reasons, I recommend accepting the paper. \n",

S4 is a relatively recent model and without this background the paper would have been impossible to follow. However, this leads to my doubt of the format these result should be published in. Possibly a note to the original paper would be better.\n- Comparisons in Table 1 are lacking 1D CNN and LSTM models\n  - I understand that the claim is that these models do not work for long sequences, but a demonstration would be helpful, especially as the S4 model has inspired some boosts in CNN's performance: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03398 https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09298",
