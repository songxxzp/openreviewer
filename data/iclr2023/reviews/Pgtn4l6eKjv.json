In order to provide good image/video quality under limited resources on mobile devices, the proposed method employs adaptive Neural Architecture Search (NAS) technique to produce model adaptation with minimum overhead. The proposed method aims to dynamically switch SR models that consistently adapts to the varying computer environments so as to balance the visual quality of super-resolution and the limited resource on the mobile devices. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method is able to provide steady throughput. \n",

This paper has clearly pointed out the strong motivation of the work and the necessity of getting a ad-hoc switchable super-resolution system that can automatically adjust the model based on the resources available in the system. I do believe the proposed method is useful in practical situations on mobile devices, especially for those low-end devices or embedded systems.\n2. This paper has compared the proposed method with state of the arts baseline methods and outperform them in terms of the processing speed as well as the accuracy using Pareto curve to indicate the validity of performance. \n\nWeaknesses\n1.  In the algorithm, one of the most important input factors to decide sub-graph is the current available resources in the devices. However, i could not find the descriptions and explanations about how to to quantify the current resources, for example, you need to balance a bunch of parameters including memory, traffic, load on CPU /GPU , etc.. This is, I believe, the important starting point to decide whether your solution is applicable to mobile systems. \n2. In this experiment, the training step is conducted on desktop-level system on A100 graphic cards. However, it is not quite clear about the deployment pipeline. If the model needs to be trained off-the-shelf and deployed on a mobile system or it should be trained on the target system otherwise the input hardware parameters are not available beforehand.\n\n\n\n1.

The method used is to identify sub-networks (graphs) within a larger network (graph) that are optimized to solving the SR problem but with varying levels of computational requirements. At run-time the whole network is loaded into memory, and then the computational paths used can be varied on the fly as computational resources change. Comparison with prior methods show the overall network and the subgraph network are competitive in their results with prior work with similar computational costs.",

Within that narrow domain, the novel contribution is maintaining the minimum quality of service while adapting to computational resources.
