The authors evaluate the proposed the method on two real-world datasets and the experimental results seem promising.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Some of the assumptions in the paper are not validated. For example, in the first paragraph of 4.1, the authors make a pretty strong assumption that the distribution of the gradients are a mixture distribution by several homogeneous distributions. I would like to see this validated on a real-world dataset.\nAnother assumption worth validating is \": We assume the availability of data of very few (20%) clients Dserver at the server for evaluating the fairness loss.\" 20% is a non-negligible percentage. Could the author give a practical scenario where such a big portion of users' data are available?\n2. Algorithm 1 is too sketchy.

I would recommend using one to two sentences to outline the dual update process and the terms before those paragraphs.\n\nQuality: Good. I like the motivation of the paper as fairness is an important yet challenging topic in federated systems. The authors propose a solution with some trade-offs and the experimental results show it works.\n \nNovelty: Low novelty. The protocol is a combination of known techniques. The proof for the sample complexity is novel but not very challenging given the strong assumptions.\n\nReproducibility: The code is included in the supplementary material. I did not have the chance to reproduce the results in the paper.",

These two assumptions are too strong that limits the value of the proposed method. \n2. It is unclear how the clients will be clustered. Because the mentioned fairness is group-wise, the clustering result is very important to decide which client will contribute to the corresponding group. \n3. In Algorithm 1, there are two subfunctions, FairMF and ClientFilling,  that need to be cleary described.\n4. Some experiment results need to further analyzed. For exampmle, in Figure 3, why all curves are very unstable at the first server rounds, and the communication rounds is too few to demonstrated that the MF is converged. In Table 3, please analyse why RS-FairFRS(100%) performs worse than RS-FairFRS(20%).\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a 3-part algorithm for an efficient and fair federated recommender system that preserves privacy. They promote privacy and efficiency by randomly sampling item gradients from only a fraction of clients. The authors present a theorem to give bounds on how the sampling rate affects accuracy. They then develop a global fair model by only using sensitive information about a client's group from a fraction of the population. The global model is then used to regularize item representations in local models to maintain fairness without exposing further sensitive information. The authors show this leads to increased model accuracy, reduced bias, and reduced communication on MovieLens datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Maintaining fairness while protecting privacy is a challenging problem, and this paper shows good progress on a real-world dataset toward achieving this aim.\n2. Multi-part algorithm is intuitive and well presented.\n3. Proof of affect of sampling rate on federated accuracy fills a gap in existing literature.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The problem of maintaining fairness and privacy is incompletely solved as their solution requires a fraction (20%) of user's to sacrifice privacy. The remaining 80% of users only enjoy partial fairness as they are only regularized by a fair model without theoretical guarantees. The authors should explain how realistically they would violate 20% of users' privacy. Perhaps this fraction is comparable to the number of users who opt out / do not opt in to privacy permissions, though this group may not be a representative sample of users overall.\n2. The proof of the error bound when sampling clients is unsurprising and seems somewhat obvious. This section can perhaps be moved to an appendix. Furthermore, there is an assumption that users are uniformly distributed among clusters, but in general in fairness, groups tend to be of unequal size.\n3. Evaluation is performed on two different sized MovieLens datasets, so the paper is closer to validating on just a single problem domain. The authors should consider other recommender system benchmark datasets.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity - Overall the paper is quite clear and easy to follow. Some interpretations were ambiguous to me, such as why their method would lead to more accurate recommendations when additional fairness constraints are imposed.\nQuality - Offline experiments are conducted in a competent way. \nNovelty - Techniques are modestly novel. They are not a far departure from existing techniques, but are combined in a novel and coherent way.\nReproducibility - Although the techniques are described clearly and use an open dataset, I do not believe the authors open-sourced their implementation.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I am marginally inclined to accept this paper. The authors address an important issue with an intuitive and well-explained algorithm. They demonstrate their technique on a real-world dataset and show improvements in efficiency, fairness, and accuracy. However, their solution still manages to violate privacy for 20% of the population while providing only incomplete fairness for the remaining users. Also the novlety of their technique is somewhat modest. The authors should use the feedback from reviews to strengthen the final version of the paper.",
