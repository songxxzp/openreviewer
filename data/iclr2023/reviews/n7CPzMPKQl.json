            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper demonstrates one way to exploit the rotation and reflection symmetry structure in path planning problems. More specifically, the authors use Value Iteration Networks (VINs) to solve the path finding problem on the Z2 space. They show that the steerable convolution can incorporate the symmetry structure in the value iteration process. Experiments show that their proposed symmetry regularization can improve the training speed, training success rate, as well as generalizability.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper flows very well and smoothly. The idea of exploiting the rotation and reflection symmetry in the path finding problem is simple but also elegant. And it is a good choice to start from Z2 space and VIN with steerable convolution. The authors formally build the connections among symmetries, value iterations, and steerable convolutions. Moreover, the experiment results further verify that this symmetry regularization does help.\n\nBesides those strengths, I might have some questions in mind. \n\nFirst, although it is intuitive that symmetries could improve the performance and the experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of such proposed inductive bias empirically, is it possible to prove or even compute quantitatively why symmetry can help the path finding problems? \n\nSecond, it is also mentioned that the symmetry structure also exists in other higher-dimensional continuous Euclidean spaces or spatial graphs (of path finding problems), can the authors provide more clues on how to generalize their method to those cases? Since the current experiments are on small scales and those mentioned more general spaces could be more practical in some real-world problems. \n\nThird, in Section 6.3, why is iteration K set to be sqrt(2)M? And why is the iteration linear to the map size?\n",

Moreover, they already promised that the code would be open-sourced. \n",

This is done by replacing standard convolutional layers (which are equivariant to translations) in differentiable planning algorithms like VINs and GPPNs with steerable convolutional layers (which are additionally equivariant to rotations and reflections). The authors also theoretically show that value operators and value iteration on 2D grids are equivariant, and this can be expressed as a steerable convolution. Experiments are performed on 2D grid / visual navigation and 2 DOF manipulation and demonstrate strong improvements over non-equivariant versions of the planning methods.",

In robotics planning, the maps can be significantly larger (e.g., 960 x 960 in Active Neural SLAM, Chaplot et al., ICLR 2020). It is unclear how the proposed method works on more complex scenarios.\n* The metrics in Table 1, Figures 6 and 7 only capture success rate and not efficiency of the predicted plan relative to an optimal planner like A*. A common metric to measure this efficiency is SPL (Success weighted by Path Length) from Anderson et al., 2018: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06757.pdf",

I'm raising my rating to accept.\n\n# Pre-rebuttal review\nThe paper tackles an important problem and proposes to incorporate equivariances in differentiable planning methods. It provides both theoretical and empirical analyses and demonstrates strong improvements over prior work. However, the results are demonstrated only in simplistic maps and do not capture closeness of planned paths to the optimal path. ",

Specifically, by manipulating the input signal in a symmetric setting (e.g. rotation and flipping for 2D space) and enforcing consensus outputs, the symmetric convolution can learn to reduce ambiguous prediction and therefore have better potential in both efficiency and accuracy. ",

Can their steerable convolution be applied to the same task with a little modification?\n- Defining the generalized symmetric operation is challenging. Although the paper demonstrates the 2D grid case where the input signal (\\mathbb{Z}) is rotated 90 deg, extending to 3D or higher dimension might be more difficult. For example, if the Euler angle represents the rotation in 3D, rotating a 3D signal with multiple 90 deg will suffer the gimbal lock. ",
