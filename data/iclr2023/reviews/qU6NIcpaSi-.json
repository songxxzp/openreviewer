            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a model called RAIN for interaction and trajectory prediction. Given the history trajectories of multiple moving agents, the RAIN model predicts their interaction weights and future trajectories.\n\nThe RAIN model works as follows. 1) It first encodes the history of each agent with an LSTM encoder. 2) It then uses pairwise attention to enrich the per-agent feature vectors. 3) It then uses a graph attention network to further infer the interaction weights. 4) Finally, it uses an LSTM decoder to predict their future trajectories.\n\nThe authors evaluated the RAIN model on two physical systems (a spring-ball system and a phase-coupled Kuramoto oscillator system) and a human walking dataset. They used the NRI method as their baseline. The evaluation result shows that the RAIN model significantly increases the accuracy of correlation prediction and reduces the trajectory MSE.",

In the evaluation section, NRI is the only public baseline that the authors compared their method against, and it's quite an old baseline. Also, there is not much discussion about the existing works in the paper.\n\n\n--- Other comments\n\n- I think there are some typos in Eq (5). It should be V_j^{t,m} instead of V_i^{t,m}. Also, I think there should be a sum over j. Otherwise, why does the subscript j disappear in the left-hand side of the equation?\n\n- I suggest the authors adjust the positions of the result tables and figures.

In Section 2.1, for the model complexity, for the pair-wise attention weights calculation, at each time step, it would be $O(N^{2})$, assuming there are $N$ objects.

However, the reviewer can't find any physical constraints are directly applied in the neural networks, nor at the neural network losses. The reviewer would like to see the actual dynamic system encoded in the NN architectures to generate more guaranteed realistic trajectories.\n\nThe experiment results include a simulated data (Table 2) and motion capture data of human walking (Table 3) seems toy-ish (although some previous works also uses those data).

The authors also combine RAIN with a \"pairwise attention\" (PA) mechanism, which greatly improves the reported performance of RAIN.\n\nThe authors describe their method and then evaluate it on spring-ball models, Kuramoto oscillators and motion capture data of a person walking.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n\nThe main strength of the paper appears to be its empirical evaluation. Evaluating on three different very different kind of systems (plus a multi-level variant of the ball-spring system) provides a significant insight into the advantages of RAIN over NRI, which can only assign discrete interaction strengths to graph edges. \n\nThe results section is further strengthened by a varied analysis combining trajectory predictions, connectivity matrices and correlation coefficients. I found that this multi-modal approach helped my appreciation of the results despite being unfamiliar with previous works.\n\nFinally, the problem of learning continuous interaction graphs from data seems challenging and highly relevant to both future research and applications.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\nThe first issue with the paper is the lack of a Background section clearly describing the problem and introducing the key variables and general approaches. Without a background section, the paper is hard to follow since it is unclear what assumptions can be made about the system or what constitutes success. \n\nSecondly, I found the Section 2 lacked clarity, partially due to the issue above but also due to writing and inconsistent notation. \nFor instance, it is not clearly stated before the method whether one trajectory describes the evolution of the entire system, or whether it is one trajectory per node. Based on the section 3, I believe it to be the latter, but sentences like the following at first let me believe it was the former, when trying to understand the method:\n\"The encoder receives $T_{enc}$ steps of trajectories $x_1, x_2, ... , x_{T_{enc}}$ , each consisting of $R$ state variables of $N$ agents, and produces corresponding $T_{enc}$ hidden states, $h_1, h_2, ... , h_{T_{enc}}$.\"\n\nRelatedly, the authors state \"we calculate the attention between _same-time hidden states_ to assign weights to their contribution\". The term \"same-time hidden states\" is never clearly defined, despite being key to PA. Additionally, Figure 2 clearly features a sum over different time-steps to compute the Pairwise Attention, which seems contradictory.\n\nAnother point of confusion is that variables used in figures 1 and 2 ($h'_{ij}, A_\\theta, w_t$) are absent from the main body of the paper, including equations. Given the two previous points, I found Figures 1 and 2 to be of little help to my understanding, overall.\n\nI also found it confusing that nodes (e.g. balls in the ball-spring system) be called \"agents\", given that they take no action. That said, feel free to ignore this comment if this is standard terminology in the field.\n\nFinally, on the experimental side, results reported lacked confidence intervals or other measures of uncertainty. I also found it slightly odd that the only baseline reported dates from 2018. \n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "**Clarity**\n\nThe paper generally lacks clarity, as mentioned in the section above. In addition to the aforementioned points, authors could consider including an algorithm block to summarize their method.\n\n**Quality**\n\nThe results appear to be strong when compared to NRI, but it is unclear to me how strong and relevant of a comparison that is given NRI dates from 2018 and was designed for graphs with discrete interactions. I am also curious for the authors to describe how NRI would perform given access to a higher number (N > 4) of edge types. Is it possible, for instance, that NRI(16) outperforms RAIN+PA, but at a huge computational cost?\n\n**Novelty**\n\nBeing unfamiliar with previous works in this field, it is difficult for me to assess novelty.\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\nIf authors follow through with their claim of releasing data and models on Github, reproducibility should not be an issue.\n\n\n",

It also presents a range of strong empirical results, albeit one that raises a few questions about the reported baseline. Also, the paper suffers from a global lack of clarity and a missing background section, which is its main weakness in my opinion.\n\nGiven that, I do not believe the paper is ready for publication, but I am willing to reassess if the issues mentioned are resolved.",
