            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a reinforcement-learning approach (that the authors call LOMAR) for edge-weighted online bipartite matching which is claimed to have good average but also worst case performance. The approach can handle both the no-free-disposal and the free-disposal setting with the second one allowing for dropping some edges from the matching to include some other ones. The main body of the paper concentrates and no-free-disposal and free disposal is deferred to the appendix.\n\nThe presented algorithm (LOMAR) is quite technical and the main novelty is involving a \"robustness constraints\" which helps decide on whether to follow the expert or the RL decision in each step. The algorithm is then analysed in terms of competitive ratio against an expert online algorithm. Finally, the RL training is incorporated within LOMAR by considering a switching operation based on the aforementioned constraint, and experiments are presented.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- Important problem that is at the core of many real-life problems.\n- Generally well written.\n- The combination of RL and robustification is quite interesting the way it is done here\n\nWeaknesses\n- It is not clear how LOMAR compares to other robust algorithms for the problem stemming from the \"learning augmented algorithms\" literature. Although these algorithms are robust as well, it seems conceivable that LOMAR has an advantage by incorporating the robustification into the learning. It would be nice to see at least experimental comparison to these results and maybe a more extensive discussion on differences and similarities (some of these papers are already cited).\n- The literature review and some citations are quite off and give the impression that the authors just searched for some keywords and wrote a couple of sentences on some papers that seemed relevant. As an example, Boyar et al., 2016 is used (i) to support that worst case performance is not necessarily good average-case performance (page 1), (ii) as an example for ML-augmented algorithms (page 2) and (iii) to support the definition of \"strict\" competitive ratio. This paper is a survey on \"advice complexity\" and although it is not wrong to cite it in the context of this paper, advice complexity (in general) concerns itself with receiving *accurate* advice and investigating what the least possible amount (and appropriate encoding) of this advice is in order to guarantee optimality. This comes in contrast to ML-augmented algorithms where the advice may be suboptimal but still needs to be incorporated in order to provide improved results in case it is adequate. Also for the definition of competitive ratio I would go to the source and cite one of the papers that introduced the concept, or perhaps a book on online algorithms. Also, I am not familiar with the Gupta and Roughgarden paper but I find it strange that it is cited as an ML-augmented algorithms paper -- since it predates the area.",

The goal of the RL algorithm is to leverage the expert such that when the RL algorithm's decision is bad while the expert algorithm's decision is good, the RL algorithm achieves robustness by using the expert algorithm's choice, while also having high enough average performance across the board, even when the expert is bad. They study this problem both in the free disposal and no-free disposal setting (where you can't throw away already matched edges) and show empirically competitive results that improves over the RL-only based algorithm.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\n+ Robustifying RL algorithms are practically important. Online Matching problems are also practically important with many economic consequences. Thus, I find combing Robust RL area with online matching an important problem and understanding the limits, foundations and novel algorithms is a key contribution. This paper makes a step and adds to this direction.\n\n+ The paper is well-written and overall, the ideas are clearly explained. The online switching based algorithm is intuitive and practical. \n\n+ The paper considers an exhaustive space of both non-free disposal and free disposal settings which are both plently available in practical settings such as ads and recommender systems.\n\n\nWeakness\n\n- The primary weakness I find is in experiments. In particular, the studied problem is actually theoretically solvable using worst-case online algorithms when the inputs are stochastic. I wonder if the authors can compare against these optimal algorithms in the experimental section. In particular, when the inputs are i.i.d., these worst case algortihms can achieve competitive ratio > 0.7 in the worst-case and sometimes much higher on a random instance. Given that in the experiments, the competitive ratio obtained is of the order of 0.7-0.8, I think this comparison would make the paper really strong.\n\n\n",

Overall the direction is significant.\n\nNovelty\n\n+ The considered robust RL algorithm for Online matching is very novel. These combine two different areas of research that don't often intersect. The paper is novel in combining disparate ideas together.\n\nReproduciblity\n\n+ As far as I can tell, the paper contains sufficient details to reproduce the experiments",

This kind of extensive analysis will be useful to future research as well as a practitioner who would like to try these ideas in the wild. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a RL-based approach for online weighted bipartite matching. A key novelty of the paper is to augment the decisions of the RL agent with a classic online algorithm to obtain robustness guarantees. Upon the arrival of an online vertex, the algorithm queries both a base online algorithm (called expert) and the RL agent. It follows the action of the RL agent unless doing so has the possibility that the algorithm incurs significant loss with respect to the expert. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ Unlike most work on learning augmented algorithms that aim to augment online algorithms with some predictions / advice from ML models; the paper takes the complementary view of an online algorithm used as a safety railing to guide a ML model.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The model feels too brittle - in the general case when the edge weights are unknown - the algorithm essentially only follows the decisions of the expert and can not use the RL agent at all. Maybe a restriction to a more specific problem would yield better insights.\n\n- It\u2019s not clear what the focus of the paper is. Section 4 is concerned with how to use the RL agent\u2019s decisions while maintaining robustness against a fixed expert. It would be better to restructure this as a meta-algorithm that takes in two algorithms A (expert) and B (RL agent): The meta algorithm switches between the actions of A and B and guarantees to maintain a given robustness wrt A while maximizing the number of times it uses actions of B. (Note that this section is completely independent of RL). Indeed, viewed in this light, the meta-algorithm and its analysis is almost trivial. [ Also worth referring to \u201ccombining\u201d algorithms for paging and metrical task systems (e.g. Fiat et al)]. \n\n- Section 5 then deals with the challenges of training the RL agent when used along with the switching algorithm above. I would much rather see more time and space allotted to this section and clarify the training process in more details.\n\n- The empirical section includes preliminary experiments and does not demonstrate strong positive results. \n",
