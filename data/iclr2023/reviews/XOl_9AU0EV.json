            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an optimization scheme to arrange a set of objects so they conform to a set of spatial constraints, that are either binary directional relationships, or specific spatial arrangements e.g. line or circle. An energy based model (EBM) is learned for each of the constraint type, which maps a set of obvious bounding boxes and locations to score that indicates how well the constraint is satisfied. These models are learned by enforcing that the ground truth layouts scores higher than perturbed layouts. At test time, a gradient-descent scheme is used to optimize the position of the objects, with the guide of the learned EBMs. The paper also incorporates off-the-shelf methods that maps language to constraints, and uses the optimized layout to guide a robotic agent. However, I am not sure if either of these relates to the central contribution of the paper. Evaluation show that the proposed method performs better than general purpose embodied agents on a set of tasks that seem to be tailored towards the proposed method. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "#Strength\n- Good empirical performance on the set of tasks evaluated. Although these tasks are rather biased towards the proposed method, it is still nice to see.\n- Optimization guided by learnable priors is a good idea and should be fairly generalizable. The ability to learn these priors with a simple MLP over object attributes is also nice to know.\n\n#Weaknesses\n### Novelty\n- Constraint-guided layout optimization is a long studied problem, see earlier works such as \"Make it home: automatic optimization of furniture arrangement\", \"Interactive Furniture Layout Using Interior Design Guidelines\" for optimization, and works such as \"Example-based Synthesis of 3D Object Arrangements\" for learnable spatial priors. In some sense, the types of constraints dealt with in these works are much more complex than those in this work.\n- While learnable spatial priors are nice, the set of relations dealt with these work is rather simple, so it is unclear whether the techniques introduced here can apply to more complex scenarios (many work suggests that neural networks struggle to perform complex spatial reasoning, especially if based on axis-aligned bounding boxes).\n- It is not clear to me what is the significance of the language to constraint module and the robotic planning module. Seems that the work can exist without either of these and neither adds much to the contribution of this work.\n\n### Design Choices\n- I am not sure whether the proposed EBMs can generalize to more complex spatial relations, especially if semantics are involved. Relations such as \"to the left of\" are rathe easy to learn and I am not seeing examples of more complex cases e.g. circle. It seems that the benefit of a learnable prior really starts to emerge for more complex cases, whereas the type of constraints studied in this paper can be easily hardcoded (in a way that allows a gradient-descent based optimization scheme).\n- I am concerned about the optimization landscape formed by the union of all EBMs. It seems that there can easily be scenarios where the optimization get stuck in a local minimum (e.g. object A starts above B, needs to move below B, but additional constraints enforce that A cannot appear to either the left or the right of B). There is a reason why many of these works I mentioned above resorts to methods more complex than simple hill climbing e.g. MCMC with large jumps, simulated annealing, etc.\n- It seems that the method will struggle in cases where not all constraints can be satisfied. Since the learned functions lacks a consistent magnitude, it can be tricky to balance the weights of different constraint and ensure that the most number of constraints can be satisfied. \n\n### Evaluation\n- Would be really helpful to visualize the learned energy function. Since the constraints studied here is rather simple, the models really don't need to learn much to lead to good results. A visualization showing a smooth function that consistently satisfies the constraints can increase my confidence in the proposed method.\n- A baseline with hardcoded rules is needed - the method won't be of much use if it performs much worse than such a baseline.",

See weaknesses above for my major concerns.\n\n### Novelty\nOptimization-based scene rearrangement is not new, there has been decades of research on this topic (see weaknesses above). Learnable EBM seems novel to me, at least with respect to the specific task, but whether they are useful is questionable.\n\n### Reproducibility\nCode is provided, looks reasonable, but probably need a bit of cleanup and a README file.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I don't know much about robotics, but it appears to me that the core of the method is the learned-prior-guided layout optimization.

As a result, while I think this method can be potentially useful, I lean towards rejection.",

Authors train the EBMs using gradient descent on the sum of energies with respect to the coordinate space, providing the final configurations that best satisfies the instructions. \nUsing this, essentially, the model reason/plan over a pixel-abstract, but bounding-box aware space to interpret the instruction, predicting a goal state.

I am wondering is the set of binary and n-ary spatial concepts open? You at least need the knowledge of which is a binary vs n-ary predicate? How do you infer that in care you are not using a list of predicates? I see you are training one EBM per predicate, which means the predicate list should be fixed right?\n\n2. In general, works such as Palm-Saycan [1] have also showed at least one experiment on real environments, such as kitchen environment, moving from table-top ones. As far as I remember, even LLMPlanner [2] uses a real-world table-top environment. I think, showing the work in such setting would help; especially given questions such as the first one.\n\n3. Generalization claim: Also, I do not see experiments performance over novel objects are shown. Among novel attributes, do you only mean shape and color? Is there anything else considered?\n\n4. LLMPlanner such as PaLM-saycan uses success predictors to give some feedback whether goal state has been reached. \nThough such goal state detection through energy minimizer is discussed, I do not see whether such a feedback mechanism exist? Some part has been discussed as physics based issues in Limitations. However, this is important, as the model only outputs final goal configuration; implying many goal configurations may be hard to achieve through pick-and-place policies in reality.

I also agree that language space may not be the best option to reason spatially about images. However, some experiments are lacking to support the generalization claims about generalizing to novel objects and attributes, alongwith experiments in real-world setting. Training each EBM to correspond to a 2-ary or n-ary predicate also raises the question of how many spatial relations that this model can support. Also, given the goal configuration is output and needs to be executed by a low-level policy executor, its easy to think of scenarios where the executor may not be able solve this using a greedy policy (stacks, tower of hanoi, inadvertently creating obstacles etc.).
