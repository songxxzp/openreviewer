            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method to prune deep neural networks. The motivation of this work is to consider DATA FLOW DRIVEN PRUNING OF COUPLED CHANNELS  (DFPC), which considers the coupled channels (CCs) in a data-free mode when conducting network pruning. The key part of this work is developing a method called DFCs that abstracts the end-to-end transformation of CCs. Then, a Maximum Score Disagreement mechanism is proposed for group saliency for DFCs. Experiments on VGG and ResNets show promising results across various image classification datasets, including Cifar10/100 and ImageNet.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n1. The paper targets the important problem of coupled channels for residual connections, which improves the performance of several classic networks.\n2. The observation of disagreement for channel importance is interesting. Before this, metrics mainly used L1 or Taylor Approximate which doesn't take any channel dependency into account. \n3. The overall writing is easy to follow.\n\nWeaknesses\n1. The authors claim that their method aims to prune channels like those fed into residual connections. However, they only conduct experiments on residual networks, and other popular networks such as mobilenets, densenets have no comparative experiments.\n2. It's hard to read the text and understand Figure4. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper tackles an important problem of neural network pruning. Specifically, the authors of the paper propose a novel method to prune coupled channels in neural networks. For instance, the layers with skip connections in the ResNet model are considered to be coupled channels. This is an under-considered problem, and most of the previously proposed pruning methods neglect these coupled channels. Nevertheless, coupled channels consist of a significant portion of many modern neural network architectures. in essence, the proposed approach involves traversing through all the paths between any pair of such couple channels, and aggregating the overall pruning scores for all of these individual paths. Then, an overall score can be determined and such couple channels can be effectively pruned. The authors of the paper conduct careful experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

While there is an analysis of the time complexity, it would be nice to also report the practical time taken to run the algorithm in practice. Does the proposed method take up significantly more time?\n- I feel like the BGSC algorithm needs more explanation. While the overview gave a good insight into the algorithm, there are a lot of technical details in the algorithm that needs to be further discussed and elaborated. ",
