The tool consists of a sequence of three components, including an improved Residual network for residue segmentation, a GNN-based framework for refining and an HMM for the final-mapping. These components are separately trained in a supervised fashion. ModelAngelo is evaluated in a test dataset of 28 map-model pairs, and shows better performance in sequence recall and backbone RMSD. The authors also discuss limitations and future research of the current implementation. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n    1. Automated model building in cryo-EM maps is an important problem worth studying. ModelAngelo is among the initiated works that use deep learning techniques. \n    2. Deep learning approaches used in ModelAngelo are technically sound. Some improvements in model architectures and learning objectives are successfully applied.  \n    3. The performance of ModelAngelo is empirically verified by a test dataset. \n\nWeaknesses\n    1. A mathematical formulation for the entire problem is missed. Though the problem is complex and difficult to be solved with an end-to-end framework, the original formulation is still needed at the beginning of the Methods section, followed by a brief introduction of the entire framework, i.e. how to split the entire task into several components and what specific role does each component play. I also suggest authors present a figure to illustrate the overall computing procedure of ModelAngelo.\n    2. Quantitive evaluation results in Figure 3 only reflect middle outputs rather than the final outputs. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison of final results with a single data sample. Thereby, current evaluations are not convincing enough to confirm ModelAngelo\u2019s superiority to competitors. Is it possible for a quantitive comparison on the final outputs?\n    3. Many losses (e.g. (RMSD) loss, backbone RMSD loss, amino-acid classification loss, local confidence score loss, torsion angles loss, and full atom loss) are involved in the learning of GNN. What are the definition of these losses? How do you get the ground truth labels required (if so) for these losses?",

The proposed model combines a CNN with a GNN component in an attention-based architectures and also requires a HMM based post-processing step.\n \nAs a first step, the authors try to approximate the location of residues by solving a segmentation task. The model is a 3D FPN trained on Cryo-EM maps in a supervised fashion, using a customized weighted loss to address data imbalance problems. Training starts using a small, manually curated subset of the data. Results are later used to prune larger datasets. \nSubsequently, the resulting map is processed by 3-stage GNN, which aims at correcting the CNN output. First module of the GNN is Cryo-EM Attention, which uses local neighborhood information by utilizing a novel graph-attention. Second is a Sequence Attention module, which is a BERT-like transformer taking as input the embedding computed by a pre-trained language model. The third and final module is Spatial Invariant Point Attention (IPA), inspired by similarly named module from AlphaFold2. The whole model is trained sequentially using several loss terms and produces 2 types of output. In the unpruned output, predicted chains are almost as-is from the output of the model, with minimal post-processing. This allows for or a larger percentage of the model to be built and gives higher recall. However, this may produce overhead for users in form of manually pruning longer sequences. \nTherefore, the authors provide an additional post-processing mechanism based on hidden Markov models, which produces lower recall results, but higher sequence matching percentages, Authors argue that this is better for end users.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The description of the problem in question is sufficiently thorough.\n2. The authors argue that the proposed method allows to build an atomic model de novo in the matter of hours compared to weeks in case of doing it manually.\n3. ModelAngelo outperforms current state-of-the-art DeepTracer in terms of sequence recall and RMSD, although it\u2019s slower due to increased overall computational needs. (Personally I don\u2019t know if there are other baselines the authors could/should compare against.)\n4. The proposed system can also provide confidence of its own predictions thanks to a special loss term.\n5. Contrary to DeepTracer, the proposed method outputs side-chain coordinates.\n6. Authors provide extensive analysis of limitation of the proposed method and possible directions of future work. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. No schematic description of the model architecture and training procedure. This made it hard for me to be sure what is really proposed and to check if I understood the overall setup of the proposed method (which certainly has many moving parts).\n2. Overall, the proposed algorithm is rather vaguely described. \n3. The same thing is also true for the proposed loss, which I would love to see better on more thoroughly described.\n4. I do know some things about cryo-EM data and workflows, but still I would have appreciated a better description of the data that goes into the proposed model.\n5. Hard to interpret and somewhat limited description of the obtained results.\n6.

This paper is not well-written and hard to follow. The problem definitions of these two steps are unclear. (1) Clear definitions of inputs, outputs, and data structures are missing.

The comparison with Deeptracer is problematic because (1) Deeptracer and ModelAngelo use different training data, which means this is not a fair comparison, and (2) compared with Deeptracer, additional protein sequence information is used as input for ModelAngelo, which is a huge assumption to the problem setting.\n3. Ablation studies are missing. The positions of alpha carbons can be obtained by the first stage only. Ablation studies are needed for a better understanding of the whole framework.\n4.

The method utilizes amino acid sequence data and prior knowledge about protein geometries in addition to cryo-EM data. Specifically, it starts with approximate locations of individual residues using a CNN and then uses a GNN that takes in information from sequence data, cryo-EM map and initial positions of atoms to refine the full atom positions of each residue. The main innovation is utilizing several aspects of protein data in contrast to traditional sequence only or cryo-EM only approaches. The results look promising, achieving better sequence recall and backbone root mean squared deviation compared to Deeptracer, though with only 28 evaluations and a longer execution time. The main limitations discussed are sensitivity to resolution, inability to achieve full atomic modeling of nucleic acids, and inability to construct models with unknown sequences. ",

The method section is vague and does not provide sufficient detail to be able to fully understand and reproduce the method. There is also a lack of detailed descriptions about the neural network architecture and ablation studies. The paper would benefit from further discussion, detailed explanation, and clarification.\n\t\t\n1. Other works combining sequence with cryo-EM: The authors mentioned several other works utilizing protein structure prediction programs to improve output predictions to fit the cryo-EM map (page 3). What are the main differences between those works and ModelAngelo? The authors claimed that \u201cSuch approaches are likely to propagate errors in the structure prediction. \u201d. What is the basis of this claim and what makes ModelAngelo not susceptible to the same problems?\n\n2. Methods section 3.1 describes the coarse location estimation module, but there are many important details left to the readers imagination. How is the dataset split into train, test and validation sets? How is the neural network evaluated and validated? What is the performance of this network? What are the choices of layers for this CNN and what is the reason behind these choices? Are there any ablation studies done for the design? \n\n3. Methods section 3.2: Again, the description of the GNN is vague. There is no description about the training, testing and validation processes nor evaluation of the model performance. Specifically how is this module designed?\n\n4. For eq(1),  \u03c7 is the characteristic function of whether x contains a C\u03b1 atom. How is this function defined? \n\n5. Time and computing resources are briefly discussed, but there does not seem to be information regarding training time for each part of the method nor the computing resources used. What kind of hardware is needed to train and generate predictions from ModelAngelo?\n\n6. The test dataset is small and the similarity between the train and test structures is unclear. It would be helpful to see evaluation of ModelAngelo on a larger number of structures and to stratify performance based on similarities to the proteins in the training set. Is it possible that some of the test proteins are structurally similar to proteins in the training set? How well does ModelAngelo perform on structures substantially dissimilar to those seen during training? Structural splits based on structural alignment scores or SCOP/CATH classes would be illuminating.\n\n7. How does ModelAngelo compare with more conventional approaches to model building such as Phenix or Rosetta?  we would like to see more metrics in comparison as well as comparison with more approaches such as Phenix and Rosetta. What about MAINMAST?\n\n8. The description of each algorithm could be more detailed. For example, how do get_cryo_key_vectors and get_cryo_point_features work?
