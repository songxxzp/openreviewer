            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper adds a patching technique to the DCT-Mask model and adopts a refinement technique for each patch, so that high-resolution masks can be achieved. The patching technique can produce better boundaries compared to the DCT mask model itself as element changes for DCT vectors can be limited to the patch level rather than the entire mask. The paper also provides many experiments to verify the capability of the proposed method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments are also provided to discuss the efficacy of the designed framework.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Introducing the patching technique to refine the generated masks to improve boundary segmentation performance and this idea is of good interest.\n2. As patching is the key technique in the paper, the patching size is also analyzed by experiments to provide a suggested 8*8 size for users. Also, other hyperparameters like the dimension of PatchDCT vectors and the number of stages for PatchDCT are clearly given and discussed.\n3. Many experiments are done to support the design.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Backbone is limited to CNN-based models. Vision transformer-based model which also uses a patching technique would be of interest to see whether they will make any difference to the conclusions.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity:\nIn general, it is clear. However, in the 4.3 section, the second paragraph did not clearly give reference to its data points. Further, it mentioned that \"MaskTransifer runs at 5.5 FPS on the A100 GPU, which is almost two times slower than PatchDCT\", however, the paper did not provide concrete data points.\n\nQuality:\nIn general, the paper is well-written.\n\nNovelty:\nThe reviewer believes that the novelty of this paper is good.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In sum, the reviewer believes that the paper provides a new refinement method to improve the results of the DCT-mask model, and experiments are done to support the design of its framework. However, it is recommended that the author address the clarity issue mentioned above, and the following comments:\n1. In table 4, with the same backbone R101-FPN, SOLQ seems to have a better performance than PatchDCT with R101-FPN. However, the authors did not give any clarification in the paper.\n2. For the classifier given in the paper in Figure 2, if a foreground patch is assigned to the background, will this patch make a rectangle hole in the object?\n3. If $N$ and $n$ are the same notation, please make them consistent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdated: 11/27\nI appreciate that the authors well-addressed my comments and questions.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a DCT-vector-based multi-stage refinement framework named PatchDCT, which contains a classifier and a regressor. PatchDCT first separates the original coarse mask into several patches. The classifier is used to distinguish mixed patches which consist of both foreground and background pixels. Then, these mixed patches are refined by the regressor with DCT-vector representation.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths :\n\n1. The paper clearly identifies that straightforward refining the global DCT vetors is unsuitable and proposes a patch-based method to overcome this issue.\n2. Foreground patch and background patch have their special DCT vector, refiner them with a three-classes-classifier rather than a general DCT regressor is theoretically sound.\n3. Compared with many other methods, this work achieves SOTA results, and ablation studies are sufficient.\n\nWeaknesses :\n1. There is only runtime result compared with Mask-RCNN and DCT-Mask. Please complement more experiments to compare the efficiency of PatchDCT with other refinement models.\n2. In this paper, the result in Table 1 suggests that when using 1x1 patch and 1-dim DCT vector the network has the best performance (57.6 AP). But when encoding 1x1 patch (single-pixel) using DCT, the result should be the value of the pixel itself. What is the difference between this method and directly refining the mask with 1x1 conv when the patch size is 1x1? I think this result is inconsistent with DCT-Mask, nor \"binary grid refinement\". According to DCT-Mask (Table 1), directly increasing the resolution decreases the mask AP, which is the main reason they use DCT encoding. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "For one thing, the work starts with the issue of straightforward refining the global DCT vectors, proposes a patch-based method to solve this issue and finally gets well performance. It's logically fluent and complete. The experiment result of multiple metrics on three popular instance-segmentation datasets is also clear.\n\nFor another, as a refinement method, the work clearly shows that very small-size compressed vectors (such as 6-dimension) can afford enough information for segmentation. This is a valuable result for the refinement task.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The compressed vector-based refinement method is relatively novel. The experiment results of multiple metrics clearly show good performance in segmentation accuracy. Complementing more experiments to compare the efficiency with other refinement models could determine further superiority of the method.\n",
