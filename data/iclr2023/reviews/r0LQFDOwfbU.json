            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new way to allow cooperation between ML agents using an approach based on a similarity measurement. Authors introduce a program called diff meta games, a novel variant of program meta games, where agents observe the similarity/dissimilarity between the policies using a single number, thus the similarity/ dissimilarity between each other, allowing the agents to learn to cooperate/defect. Authors theoretically and experimentally show the validity of their method of similarity-based cooperation. They prove that this approach allows the same cooperative outcomes as in the full mutual transparency setting. Moreover, they experimentally show that cooperative learning through this approach can be achieved with simple ML methods. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Mathematically rigorous results are obtained and the experiments are done to back up the claims. The paper presents contributions for enhancing similarity based cooperative learning between ML agents and clearly explains how their approach presents solutions to difficulties with existing methods. \nPaper compares full transparency setting vs their approach and explains how the proposed method addresses problems of existing methods in great detail. The authors could consider explaining the results more in a more accessible way to broader audience and elaborate connections to representation learning. \nThe paper is dense and needs more clarifications.\n\nMinor: You have used a distance measure as the similarity measurement. Does the direction matter? i.e. is diff(\u03b81,\u03b82) = diff(\u03b82,\u03b81) in general or should the measurement change according to the perceiver? ",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Could the authors provide a discussion about how their work is related to works in the following line of research?\n\n__Assortative matchmaking__\n\nSome papers (e.g. Wang et al 2018, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05931.pdf) shows that the mechanism of matching individuals who have similar behaviour can encourage cooperation in social dilemmas (and even sequential social dilemmas). Wang et al (2018) gave a matchmaking system in which before an episode, agents measure their similarity (with respect to the rewards) to each other, and similar agents will be matched together. Pro-social behaviour can be observed under this mechanism. The authors also discussed the theoretical ground of this method. The authors can also see many citations to previous methods on matchmaking in this paper.\n\nThe reviewer noticed the some differences between the proposed method and matchmaking. However, the reviewer also believes that the two ideas are similar in spirit.\n\n__Homophily__\n\nHomophily is a very well-studied approach in the field of cooperation emergence. It has shown that if agents are encouraged to be similar to each other, cooperation is more likely to emerge. One insight is that homophily can solve the issue of second order social dilemma. The reviewer just lists some related areas where the concept of homophily has been investigated. For example: \n- [1] Di Stefano, Alessandro, et al. \"Quantifying the role of homophily in human cooperation using multiplex evolutionary game theory.\" PloS one 10.10 (2015): e0140646. \n- [2] Aksoy, Ozan. \"Effects of heterogeneity and homophily on cooperation.\" Social Psychology Quarterly 78.4 (2015): 324-344. \n\n\nThe authors may also want to discuss the prior findings in evolutionary game theory. For example, \n\n-Christian Hilbe, \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n \u0160imsa, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Martin A Nowak, \u201cEvolution of cooperation in stochastic games.\u201d",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ The paper clearly states its contributions. These contributions include the introduction a specific game called \"diff meta games,\" and theoretical analysis regarding these games. This analysis leads to the claimed contribution that cooperative equilibria can be found with ML methods.\n+ The paper gives an appropriate if dense set of preliminaries in Section 2.\n+ The intuition/motivation added in the second to last paragraph of Section 6 is helpful.\n+ Section 8's discussion section is helpful.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-Figure 1 is, unfortunately, not beneficial. It appears to setup a typical prisoner's dilemma (Figure 1a). Figure 1b is not explained in the text. These figures should be removed or better explained (or illustrated differently).\n-Table 1 does not show the only formulation of a Prisoner's Dilemma -- \"G+1\" could be any number k > G.\n- The definitions (e.g., Definition 1 and 2) are not explained from an intuitive perspective or with a set of working examples until Example 1. This reviewer recommends each definition add intuition to unpack what is going on rather than waiting for Example 1. Even example 1, however, is more of an illustrative set of cases rather than a grounded example with actual numbers (e.g., \"N_i is some real-valued random variable\"). \n-\"Appendix C.2, but give\" should not have a comma.\n-The pretraining procedure in Section 6 is only briefly described. More details could/should be given.\n-The value of Figure 2 is unclear.\n-Figure 3 is poorly formatted and difficult to parse.\n-More discussion of limitations would be helpful. For example, how large can games be (rows and columns of the normal form game formulation) before the method breaks down?\n-The result that a single number being shared can achieve cooperation is perhaps not as impressive if one considers that the number could be a real-valued number with an infinite number of digits. Can the nature of this number be restricted?\n-What happens if agent(s) are byzantine?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is dense and, while technically precise, lacks clarity. Much detail is left for the appendix and the reader's effort. Such is typical of game theoretic papers, but, this paper would have a greater impact if the details were better explained.\n\nThe results roughly and empirically support the theoretical analysis, but a definitive \"proof positive\" result in the empirical section is missing. The results are also difficult to parse.\n\nThe work appears novel. \n\nCode is provided in the supplementary materials.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper provides theoretical and empirical results investigating Prisoner Dilemma-like games and whether agents might be cooperative under minimal information sharing. The theoretical analysis is a strong positive for the paper (plus the empirical results); however, the paper is difficult to parse.
