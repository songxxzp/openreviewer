The design is within the framework of verifiable computing, where the adversaries are detected before recovering the final results. However, by modifying the encoding polynomials (using squeezed polynomial codes particularly), the required number of verifications is reduced. Therefore, the proposed design reduces the overall computation time compared to earlier proposed approaches, although requiring slightly stronger assumptions on the adversaries.",

The authors have revised the paper significantly. As far as the reviewer can see, all major issues on those aspects are resolved. I only have one minor suggestion on the definition of the recovery threshold. In prior works that consider strong adversaries and apply forward error-correcting approaches, the recovery threshold counts the total number of workers that returns the computation result, but here the definition only counts non-adversarial workers. The reviewer understands that in the framework of verifiable computing, the version presented in this work can be expressed in a simpler formula, which could confuse readers who have seen the other version. The reviewer suggests adding a discussion immediately after the definition of recovery threshold to clarify this difference.   ",

A error correction coding scheme is developed that simultaneously detects corrupt computations via random-key-based verification, and can decode in the presence of stragglers. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ The simultaneous handling of polynomial-based verification and stragglers in a distributed computing context seems new.  \n\nWeaknesses;\n- A natural scheme is to verify each node separately to check if the result is adversarial. The benefit of the proposed scheme over this approach, as I understand it, is that it is computationally more efficient - but the gain appears to be small for large matrices. Assuming that all matrices are $N \\times N$,  verification is of order $O(N^2)$. The proposed scheme performs one verification for every $m$ nodes, instead of one for every node, but I am not convinced that this is practically very important when $N \\gg m$. Note that gain in computational complexity comes at the cost of a significant assumption - that the adversarial nodes do not collude. This is quite a weak assumption in the context of security literature. \n\n- Although matrix multiplication is important, the paper (main body) does not directly test their results in the context of a machine learning application. The supplemental section does seem to have an application, but it is too sparse in the details for reproduciblity (e.g., how are the codes applied? What is the developed accuracy? What are the wallclock times of various schemes?).\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The technical parts are explained quite clearly. The introduction and the paper is written in quite a winding way, and does not state the main contribution directly, I would recommend writing a more focused introduction. \n- The weaknesses section of the view above also provides examples of lack of clarity in terms of experiments. \n- The statements pertaining to Chebyshev polynomials and their applicability to condition seem flawed. This is because Chebyshev polynomials are defined over reals (and this assumption is also made in the appendix in the paper), but Proposition 1 requires a polynomial over finite fields.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper has several major weaknesses including (1) a weak model for adversary, (2) lack of precision in writing some parts, and (2) lack of satisfactory experimental evaluation details for the ML applications mentioned. The positive side (lower computation overhead) seems too thin for large matrices to compensate for the above drawbacks.\n",
