And based on the analysis, the authors leverage the characteristics of the frequency domain for structure preservation and non-uniform style transfer. I think the idea is interesting and insightful. The usage also proves the application value. \n+ The analysis is not limited to a simple style model but a general UST framework. \n\n**Weaknesses:**\n+ Comparing to the phase part, relating amplitude to Gram matrices is less convincing. Since amplitude is only related to the diagonals of Gram matrices, which is more similar to the channel-wise second order statistics of feature maps in the style loss of AdaIN than the Gram -based style loss. The amplitude didn\u2019t explain the key inter-channel correlations in the Gram matrices. Compared to AdaIN, WCT also uses inter-channel correlations to model image styles. Therefore, I think it will be more appropriate to use other word than Gram matrices here. \n\n**Some small issues:**\n+ Some typos. For example, ``Next, We demonstrate``, \n+ In Table I, why LinearWCT has better scores in Time but the scores of AdaIN is bold? \n+ Figure 4, (b) is the style transfer results rather than the style image. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper analyzes the global style transfer method from the perspective of Fourier analysis. Specifically, the formula of style transfer is converted into Fourier transform under the umbrella of global statistics. Thus the relationships between Fourier phase (Fourier amplitude) and content loss (Gram matrix) are achieved. In this way, the authors design the phase replacement operation to improve the preservation of content structure and the frequency combination operation for content & style feature interpolations with different frequency components.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n+ Apply frequency decomposition for the holistic statistics-based style transfer method.\n+ Building the relationship between content loss (&& Gram matrix) and amplitude (&& phase) of Fourier transform.\n\n\nWeakness:\n+ The designed method in this paper is completely based on the holistic style statistics hypothesis, which limits its performance. The authors propose two operations to enhance the content structure of stylized results and interpolate between $F_{cs}$ and $F_c$ respectively. However, it is still at the cost of balancing the style information and content structures. See point 2 for details. So I would say this contribution to the style transfer task seems to be limited.\n+ From Fig. 1, the results of this method are weaker than those of WCT regarding the style textures; for example, the color of the content image (e.g. green regions) are preserved on the $3^{rd}$ and $5^{th}$ columns. Therefore, does it mean that the phase replacement operation plays a negative effect on the preservation of style features? This can also be reflected in Fig. 2. I assume that this is connected to the fact that Eq. (8) contains a cosine term with different channel features, and the phase replacement operation will weaken this relationship, thereby damaging the style characteristics in the results.\n+ Patch based style transfer methods (e.g. SANet) and methods combining patch alignment and holistic statistics matching (e.g. AvatarNet), also aim for the issues of spatial structure distortion, and thus can maintain a good content structure. The authors should make comparisons with such methods.\n+ This submission mainly depends on the qualitative comparisons, which might be very subjective. I suggest to use some widely used quantitative metrics, like perceptual loss, to evaluate the capability in capturing style patterns. At least, the authors should perform some user studies over randomly generated results.\n+ As far as I know, the running speed of linear WCT is comparable to that of AdaIN. However, in Tab. 1, the running speed of linear WCT is four times more than that of WCT, and even fourteen times more than that of AdaIN, which is inconsistent with other papers.\n+ How to enhance the stylistic features in synthesized results is the core issue of style transfer. It would be better, if the authors can improve it from the perspective of Fourier transform. For instance, the authors can weigh the $F_{cs}$ and $F_c$ with different frequency characteristics for trade-off. I look forward to more interesting frequency-based manipulation strategy for stylized images.\n+ There is still no user study result.\n+ How to do the quantitative experiments is also unclear. For example, how to select the input content && style images? How to select the synthesized images to compute metrics? Can the authors release their test data for later reproduction? What are the resolutions of test images?\n+ The selected representative images look too similar to LinearWCT. And its running speed is also unconvincing. I ran many experiments with this method before and it is even faster than AdaIN. Considering the limited visual performance, I would say the empirical improvement is very trivial.\n+ Some other experiment problems: e.g. the compared methods are a bit out-of-date; More state-of-the-art methods should be compared with, like MCCNet [1] and StyTr2 [2].\n\n[1] Arbitrary Video Style Transfer via Multi-Channel Correlation, AAAI 2021.\n\n[2] StyTr2:Unbiased Image Style Transfer with Transformers, CVPR 2022.\n\n====== My last NeurIPS comments ======\n\nThank the authors for their further feedback with details! After reading the response, however, I would like to preserve my opinions.\n\nWith the updated running time, it can be seen that LinearWCT is ~25 faster than the proposed one and having comparable (even better) results. It is very hard to convince me to give a positive rate.\n\nThus, I encourage the authors to improve their paper by incorporating the suggestions from all the reviewers into their revisions.\n\n\n====== Other comments ======\n\nHere I do not plan to append more comments from other NeurIPS reviewers now, but I do agree with some of their feedbacks including concerns about the technical novelty, limited experimental improvements and lack key evaluation results. Especially for the technical novelty and limited experimental improvements, all the NeurIPS reviewers have serious concerns. Thus I think these issues should be addressed before acceptance.",

But as I mentioned during NeurIPS review, some main concerns need to be addressed before acceptance.

It is well-known that the phase information contains the structural information of an image. In style transfer, one may want to have strong strokes or textures. However, since the proposed method replace the phase information directly, this is hard to be done by design. To me, this method seems to work better for photorealistic stylization, not artistic.\n\n* Even the metrics shown in Table 1 is using SSIM, which is the metric for checking structural preservation, not perceptual quality. If this method is meant for artistic style transfer, please measure some perceptual metrics such as GRAM difference to the results of the original optimization method and user study. That said, please perform user studies asking various aesthetic aspects using randomly generated results. \n* Missing comparison to relevant work. The problems of spatial structure distortion are also addressed by SANet and AvatarNet, which are reported to preserve content structure pretty well with nice stylization effect. The writers ought to contrast their approaches with similar ones.\n* Overall, the results seem to be very weak. For example, the authors say that the FC gives better controllability and stylization by manipulating them in frequency domain (eq. 12). However, in my opinion, this gives more unnatural effect at the edges (e.g., boundaries of buildings, Figure 10) compared to the linear combination. Where to apply styles in terms of frequency difference seems not to be a good choice since content of an image is a more entangled entity that cannot be detached merely by frequencies. \n\nMinor\nLine 58, Next, We -> Next, we\n\n",
