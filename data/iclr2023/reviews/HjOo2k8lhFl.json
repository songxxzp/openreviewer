            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies learnability of (coarse) correlated and Nash equilibria supported on rationalizable actions in unknown multiplayer normal-form games. After introducing the relevant concepts, the authors derive the first main result: a probabilistic bandit algorithm that identifies a rationalizable action profile using a number of samples inversely quadratic in an elimination reward gap and linear in the number of players (N), maximum number of actions (A), and a minimum number of iterations to eliminate dominated actions. This result serves as a stepping stone to the next two algorithms, finding rationalizable correlated and coarse correlated equilibria with sample complexities extending the action-profile-algorithm with additional (at most quadratic) terms. As a side-product, the authors obtain also a sample complexity of finding rationalizable Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games. The last main result consists of two algorithms capable of \u201crationalizing\u201d an arbitrary black-box algorithm for computing correlated or coarse correlated equilibrium using N*A calls to the black-box and a number of additional samples at most quadratic (in case of coarse correlation) or cubic (in case of standard correlation) in the game\u2019s parameters. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "I find this work very well written in terms of both quality of prose and the overall exposition. All notions the authors introduce are well described, and the notation is clear and easily comprehensible. The paper also competently explains how the presented work fits into the literature on the topic. The theory seems solid, I briefly went through the proofs in the appendix and as far as I can tell, they apper to be correct. I especially liked the black-box techniques the authors present. \n\nWhat I am missing a bit in the main text is some more in-depth analysis of the motivation that would highlight the importance of this work, perhaps some illustrative examples \u2026 something along the lines of showing what could actually happen in practice if not rationalizable (C)CEa are adopted? What is a possible degradation in terms of utility? I assume I may find some analysis in the cited works, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling of being slightly uncertain of how important this problem truly is.\n\nMy other concern relates to the potential uses of the derived sample complexities and how to estimate them in practice. If I understand this work correctly, the authors work in the bandit setting when the underlying game is unknown. While N and A are given, and delta could be chosen, how could the \u201cL\u201d be computed in the bandit case, given that you need it to run Algorithm 1 (line 2)? Even if the original utilities are fully observable, how difficult is it to compute \u201cL\u201d? If I am not wrong, this definition of strict dominance is with respect to mixed strategies, so calculating \u201cL\u201d corresponds to iteratively resolve the linear programs from the original work by Vincent Conitzer. How difficult is it in contrast to the algorithms presented in this paper? Or is \u201cL\u201d not supposed to be computed in practice? If yes, are there some reasonable bounds on \u201cL\u201d that would allow us to estimate the expected solution quality given some supply of samples?\n\nFinally, just a few nits:\n(i) The introduction presents the sample complexities without explaining at all what delta is.\n(ii) The delta symbol is then further used both as the \u201creward gap\u201d in the definition of rationalizability and to denote distributions over some set \u2026 Is there some connection between the two that would justify the use of the same notation that I am missing?\n(iii) FTRL remains undefined on page 2, I assume this is the follow-the-regularized-leader.\n",

The paper focuses on normal-form games with stochastic payoffs, under the bandit feedback model. First, it provides an algorithm that can be used to learn any rationalizable action profile. Then, it uses such an algorithm as a subroutine to design sample-efficient no-regret learning algorithms for CCEs and CEs. The paper provides two variants of such algorithms: one is based on a modification of the Hedge algorithm, while the other works by using any standard no-regret algorithms as a subroutine, at the expense of achieving \"slightly\" worse regret bounds. The paper also provides a lower bound showing that the sample complexity of the first variant of the algorithms is optimal with respect to the number of players and the number of actions. ",

The proposed algorithms are rather unnatural and although can be used to compute CCE do not provide no-regret guarantees themselves.

Also, if \"natural\" learning algorithms like Hedge and variants do not reproduce iteratively rationalizable CCE fast isn't this an indication that maybe iterative rationalizability is not a \"natural\" property?\n2) The algorithms are rather impractical to use and result in significant blow-ups e.g. the sampling complexity grows linearly in the number of agents whereas without it there is no dependence on the number of agents.\n3) There are no proposed interesting practical applications of this idea (also no experimental section)",
