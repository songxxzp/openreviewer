SoftZoo explores a differentiable material point method (MPM) to simulate soft bodies and their interaction with different terrain types, and the soft robots are actuated through anisotropic elastic energy.  The authors constructed a set of biologically inspired soft robots and benchmarked their performances in various environments, and discussed the importance of design space representations and the ambiguity between design and control optimization.",

For example, section 3.2 discussed various baselines used to perform gradient based design optimization. However, even combining the appendix it is still difficult to understand how the design optimization is actually performed. Another example is the colored muscle groups. The word \u201cmuscle group\u201d has appeared twice in the paper without a proper definition. I assume this has something to do with the design optimization. \n2) The website is not well constructed with many illustrations missing. \n",

It includes the design parameterizations for designs and control policies, task definitions, environments created in the TaiChi differentiable simulator, and prior co-design algorithms. The paper also introduces experiments to analyze the problem of soft robot co-design from multiple perspectives: how biologically inspired morphologies perform in different environments, choice of design spaces, muscle stiffness, and the use of differentiable simulation. Finally they demonstrate co-optimization for a robotic swimmer.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The paper is well motivated, and the proposed platform seems like it will help to drive research in the direction of developing improved co-design algorithms. It supports a variety of design parameterizations and diverse terrain types.\n- Compared to prior platforms, SoftZoo is differentiable (unlike EvoGym) and supports more tasks (unlike DiffAqua) but only supports locomotion tasks (a weakness).\n- The experimental analysis is very insightful. I think that they highlight several of the most critical issues currently in the co-optimization of design and control. \n- The presentation of the paper is clear and it is well written. The visualizations of the demos are really nice!\n\nWeaknesses:\n- As mentioned earlier, the tasks are all locomotion tasks. Therefore their complexity is somewhat limited, especially because the different terrains may not require as much specialization in design compared to, say, manipulation tasks.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: The paper is clearly written, and experimental details are described thoroughly.\n\nQuality: The experiments are thorough, although I would hope to see additional random seeds from RL experiments (although I understand that this is computationally very heavy).\n\nNovelty: As mentioned in strengths, existing frameworks for soft robot co-design either are not differentiable or are relatively narrow in task selection. Additionally, this paper presents novel analysis in its empirical studies.\n\nNitpick: Typo at the end of section 4: \u201crobitics\u201d",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In summary, this paper presents a benchmark built on a differentiable simulator for the co-optimization of design and control of soft robots. It allows testing locomotion tasks in a variety of terrains. The paper is well-executed and provides valuable analysis, and I think this benchmark will be a nice contribution to the field. ",
