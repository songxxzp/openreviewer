            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers the problem of predicting the number of tourists visiting different attractions on an hourly basis. Using data from 32 tourist attractions in Salzburg over a four-year time span, the paper compares 7 different deep learning approaches against a classical approach (ARIMA). The paper also explores the use of additional data (sparse geo-location information from tourists and metadata about weather and holidays). ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strengths\n* The paper addresses an interesting spatiotemporal prediction problem.\n* The paper attempts the important work of benchmarking a diverse collection of methods on a difficult task.\n* The dataset which this paper will publicly release will no doubt be useful to the community, especially since it has data for before and during COVID. \n* Investigating the use of side information (sparse geo-location information from tourists and metadata about weather and holidays) is worthwhile and interesting. \n\n\n# Weaknesses\n* The paper trains 7 different deep learning approaches with the same learning rate and reports the results. I believe it is uncontroversial to claim that tuning the learning rate is perhaps the most important step in training a deep learning algorithm. Given this, it is difficult to trust the results in the paper. \n* It is not clear whether a validation set was used or (if a validation set was used) how it was constructed. Also, which split is used for model selection? \n* The ARIMA model gets to use the true values for past time points before making a prediction. Do the deep learning models get a similar advantage? If so, how is it implemented?\n* The results are not contextualized. At what point is an improvement meaningful? Are MAE and RMSE effectively capturing what is important for the end-user? For instance, in Table 1 we see that GRU-D is better than CT-RNN by 0.01 RMSE when doing \"only visitors\" prediction. Is this a meaningful difference for the use case? Does this represent a stable difference between the models, or would the results reverse if we trained again?\n* There is no discussion of the potential for bias in the data. Is there a good reason to believe that Salzburg Card holders are a representative sample of the population of tourists? How is the mobile phone data sampled from the population? If these datasets are biased, what effects could they have on the models? ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "* Clarity & Quality: The paper has typos, duplicate text, and other formatting errors. See the \"typos\" section below. The figures and tables are generally in good shape. \n* Novelty: The paper does not propose a novel method, but does provide a new dataset and new experimental results on that dataset. I have no objections to the paper on the grounds of novelty. \n* Reproducibility: The paper trains 7 deep learning models but only provides a handful of hyperparameters in the appendix - I suspect more information is needed for reproducibility. The paper promises to release code and data. \n\nMinor comments:\n* Consider moving the discussion of RNNs / LSTMs / GNNs / etc. from the introduction to the related work sections. \n* \"The backshift operator\" is not defined on page 5. \n* The \"POI\" acronym is not defined before it is used in the abstract.\n* It would be nice to see an ablation study showing the relative importance of the different \"external features\" (sparse location data, weather, holidays).\n* Please be careful to separate speculation from real claims, e.g. \"The improvements were quite marginal because we have limited training data available and thus increasing the number of features does not pay off, or even might result in over-fitting.\" is stated definitively, but seems to be speculation. \n\nTypos:\n* \"full-fill\" should be \"fulfill\" on page 2\n* \"Mobilephone-Apps\" should be \"mobile phone apps\" on page 2.\n* \"Mobilephone-data\" should be \"mobile phone data\" on page 2.\n* There is duplicate text at the bottom of page 3 / top of page 4. \n* \"march\" should be \"March\" on page 4. \n* \"In this section we first introduce the dataset...\" on page 4 does not accurately reflect the order of what is to follow. \n* \"destinct\" should be \"distinct\" on page 4. \n* There are more, but I stopped keeping track. \n",
