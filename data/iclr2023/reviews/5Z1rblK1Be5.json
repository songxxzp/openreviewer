            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes the new notion of risk-averse equilibrium (RAE) for multi-player games, which generalizes the single agent risk-averse mean-variance framework. RAE consists of an equilibrium point of the modified game where a trade-off term representing the variance of the rewards is added to the usual expected reward. Authors prove the existence of RAEs, as well as that RAEs retain the convergent guarantees of standard stochastic fictitious play. Moreover, for large games, a population based RL approach by (Lanctot et al., 2017) is adapted to compute RAEs. Finally, several experiments are performed showing that RAEs: 1) identify minimum variance solutions for any given level of utility 2) can be used as a Nash equilibrium selection tool in the presence of a \"risk-dominant\" equilibrium 3) are able to find a low risk strategies in a safety-sensitive environments such as autonomous driving.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The notion of RAE, to the best of my knowledge, is novel and can be interesting to the community.\n- Conceptual benefits of RAEs are not only discussed but also supported by several experiments.\n\nWeaknesses/Questions: \n- The authors do not relate the proposed RAEs with its single-agent risk-averse counterparts. In which sense is this a generalization?\n- Why that particular choice of augmented MDP was used to approximate rewards variance? I guess this is the main difference w.r.t. the existing methods so I believe it deserves further explanations. \n- The experiments are performed with a sweep over the trade-off parameter $\\gamma$. However, in practice, one does not know a reasonable value of $\\gamma$ upfront and thus could reach low expected utilities as a consequence. How do you foresee $\\gamma$ to be chosen? Perhaps, an adaptive approach could be used throughout training? \n\n",

Moreover, I believe there is a typo since problem (8) and (9) have different objectives and constraints.\n- it is hard to follow the sentence across pages 8 and 9, since little white space is left below caption of Fig. 5.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper defines a notion of risk-averse equilibrium, develops some theory surrounding the notion, and runs some experiments illustrating that their notion achieves a better trade-off between utility and variance than other notions.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Broadly speaking, risk aversion is usually implemented by passing the utility function of the risk-averse player through a concave function, after which the player will become more risk-averse. That would be insufficient to handle the chicken game though-- a chicken game with utilities passed through a concave function is still a chicken game and will still have the \"undesirable\" equilibria. As such, I find the premise and motivating example of this paper--that there is some notion of equilibrium under which (Stay, Stay) is actually an equilibrium in a chicken game--interesting. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot seem to understand the technical portion of the paper, including in the motivating example, due to what appear to be errors in the writing. Here are some concrete questions, in order of appearance in the paper.\n\n\n1. Eq (3-4), which seems to be absolutely critical to the paper, doesn't really make sense to me. It is also inconsistent with Eq (23-24) in Appendix H, and I'm not sure which one is the one intended by the authors.\n\n    **a)** The denominator $1 - \\sum_a \\varsigma(a)$ is always zero. I'm assuming that this should be $1 - \\sum_a \\varsigma(a)^2$, matching (23). \n\n    **b)** In the main body, I am assuming that the utilities $u(a_i, a_j)$ and $u(a_i, a_k)$ should instead be $u(a_j, a_i)$ and $u(a_k, a_i)$, matching (23).\n\n    **c)** I am assuming that, in the appendix, the exclusion of the subscript $\\boldsymbol\\varsigma$ is a mere notational oversight and not an indication that $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{M}_1}$ does not actually depend on $\\boldsymbol\\varsigma$.\n\n    **d)** $\\mathbf{\\bar M}\\_i = \\frac{1}{|A|} \\sum_{k=1}^{|A|} \\sigma_k u_i(a_i, a_k)$ (immediately after Eq (3)): assuming $\\sigma_k$ should be $\\varsigma_k$\n    \n    **e)** In (4) and (24), the $\\sum_k \\sum_{n > k}$ term should be multiplied by 2.\n\n    With the above fixes, it seems that $\\boldsymbol \\sigma^\\top \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\mathbf{M}, \\boldsymbol\\varsigma} \\boldsymbol\\sigma$ should be, roughly speaking, the variance that player 2 contributes to player 1's utility under profile $(\\boldsymbol\\sigma, \\boldsymbol\\varsigma)$, scaled by $1 / (1 - \\lVert \\boldsymbol\\varsigma \\rVert_2^2)$. Also, it is unclear to me what the intuition is behind the scaling factor. I would appreciate the authors explicitly including extra discussion surrounding the equilibrium notion.\n\n1. Even the fixed formulation would divide by zero when $\\lVert \\boldsymbol\\varsigma \\rVert_2^2 = 1$, i.e., when $\\boldsymbol\\varsigma$ is a pure strategy. In particular, that seems to happen in the example calculation at the end of Sec 4.1. The authors do write \"all actions will still receive positive probability in our framework\", but the example is clearly is not fully mixed. What is the calculation used in the example to conclude that (Stay, Stay) is an equilibrium? In any case, for the rest of my review I will assume that $\\boldsymbol\\varsigma$ is actually fully mixed and therefore there is no division by zero.\n\n1. The use of the variance in Eq (5), in particular instead of standard deviation, seems rather strange to me, as it implies that the resulting notion of equilibrium will not be scale-invariant: a player whose utilities are halved will suddenly find herself essentially less risk-averse, because the variance will be cut by 1/4. This feels like it requires further motivation.\n\n1. In Proposition 1, what is $u_b$? Eq (6) contains no $u_b$ nor an obvious place to insert one.\n\n1. Theorem 4's proof sketch in the paper body seems wrong: $\\text{Var}(\\boldsymbol\\sigma, \\boldsymbol\\varsigma, \\mathbf M)$ is quadratic in $\\boldsymbol\\sigma$, and therefore cannot possibly have arbitrarily large gradient at the boundary of a compact set (namely, a simplex). Also, I have no a priori reason to believe that the variance is *strictly* convex (as requried by SFP), merely convex. Am I missing something? \n\n\nRelatively minor things not affecting my score:\n\n1. Related work, second paragraph, \"suggesting strategic uncertainty is by\" - seems like an unfinished sentence.\n1. $\\sigma_k$ and $\\sigma(a_k)$ are both used to mean the probability that a mixed strategy $\\sigma$ assigns to action $k$. In the interest of cleanliness, I'd advise picking one of the two and sticking with it.\n1. Indices $i, j, k$ are used to index both players and actions at various points in the paper. This is unnecessarily confusing; I'd advise again using indices to mean only one thing. For example, $i, j$ can index players, and $a, a'$ can index actions.\n1. The theorem numbering in the appendix is inconsistent with the numbering in the main body. This is unnecessarily confusing. For example, Theorems 3 and 4 in the main body are proven as Theorems 4 and 5 in the appendix, respectively.",

Traditional methods, such as quantal response equilibrium, are not able to resolve such tasks perfectly.\n- A learning method based on the stochastic fictitious play is proposed for the equilibrium, and a theoretical guarantee is provided as long as the SFP sequence converges.\n- An RL-based learning algorithm is available to handle large games, where the empirical performance of the algorithm is promising. It offers a way to find min variance strategies for a given expected utility and select Nash equilibrium in the risk-dominant equilibria.\n\n**Weakness:**\n- The authors showed the existence of the mean-variance equilibrium, but the uniqueness of the risk-averse equilibrium is still lacking. Which equilibrium those proposed algorithms converge to is not clear to me.\n- Proposition 1 shows that there exists $\\gamma$ such that the solution is the min variance solution.
