Another minor conceren is that the submission is not self-contained very well; it is confusing to see some notations without definition, e.g., $\\gamma_t(k)$ above Eq.(7) and below Eq.

For example, did ARIMA include a seasonal component, how exactly was LSTM specified and trained, what was the choice of the kernels in GP-based approaches etc.? \n\nMinor: it would be useful if Table 1 and Table 3 highlighted the best-performing methods to get an overall picture better. \n\n",

A Gaussian process regression is applied to the intra-day time series and then inter-day correlations are modeled through the hidden Markov chain. A Bayes version (BHM-GPFR) of the proposed model (HM-GPFR) is proposed to further improve the robustness of the method. The effectiveness of the proposed is demonstrated through an application to the electricity load data.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: the paper is well-written and easy to follow.\nWeakness: the proposed method is only a straightforward extension of the existing literature, e.g., [1]. The only difference is to introduce of the correlation between the indicator variables via a Markov chain. The benefits of this modification, however, are not well justified.\n\n1. The performance of the proposed method is only evaluated through one data set and results are not very impressive compared to existing methods (mix-GPFR, DPM-GPFR). In addition, the real data has too many irregularities and it is hard to grasp the idea of what are the advantages and limitations of the proposed method. In my opinion, this can be better achieved through carefully designed synthetic experiments, especially considering that the work is purely empirical.\n\n2. In section 5.1, it is probably better to consider SARIMA model compared to the SARMA model because the process is clearly nonstationary even after taking into account the seasonality.\n\n3. In section 5.3, HM-GPFR and BHM-GPFR perform better when $r=1$. Can you study how the performances change as $r$ gradually increases? This perhaps will give more insights into why the proposed method work.\n\n4. In equation (6), the transition probability only depends on the previous state, which may not be very suitable for grid data. It may be a better idea to include other coarse-level covariates such as predicted temperature, day of the week, etc.\n\n5. The claim on page 2, \"while HM-GPFR can adjust the parameters incrementally without retraining the model \", is not correct. The model parameters still need to be updated when new data are available.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Shi, Jian Qing, and B.
