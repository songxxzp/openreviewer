It is mentioned that two diffusion models are used in image encoding and decoding. How to train these two diffusion models? What is the loss function?\n2. The authors state \"Our method is limited in its application to  color transfer, as one model is required for each image, which demands significant compute for mass  experiments.\" For the color transfer task, why one model is required for each image?\n3. Too few comparison methods are used in the experiments. Except for Section 4.2, there is no comparison method in the rest of the experiment. The paper presents only several quantitative experimental results. Moreover, the provided quantitative results is not enough to show the superiority of the proposed method.

The synthetic image translation task nicely demonstrates the merit of this work.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nWhile the author discusses the privacy protection of medical images, they lack corresponding experiments to confirm the translation performances on medical images.\nWhile natural image patterns are usually varying and contain different foreground&background contexts even within one class, medical image translation focuses the detail preservation. Therefore, it is not clear if such a separately training method is capable to handle the task.\n\nConsidering the privacy protection problem, we can employ two well-pretrained auto-encoders, named A&B, for both source&target domains(denoted S and T) to obtain latent encodings A(S) and B(T), which mapping retains domain information mostly. Then we can utilize other image-to-image translation models (GAN-based or normalizing flow-based) to jointly train a model on latent encodings and protect data privacy. I am curious about the practical differences and performance differences between the DDIB and such a direct manner. Can the authors provide a detailed discussion?",
