It designs a vortex dynamics module to learn the evolution of the vortices and another network to transform from the vortex space to the image space velocity field. Results show that the proposed method provides a realistic and stable vortex evolution trajectory, both in synthetic and real-world videos.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. Instead of modeling the entire image space dynamics, the method models only the vortex information, which effectively reduces the dimension and difficulty, and also helps generalize to unseen cases.\n2. The results are very promising. They clearly outstand previous works.\n3. The experimental comparisons are thorough and complete. They support the claims well.\n\nWeakness:\n1. There should be more detailed descriptions in the method section. For example, how are the vortex positions initialized? Are they inferred from the image or overfitted to the given example? How does the model determine how many vortices to model given an image? I don't see a module to encode this information from the input image to the vortex space.\n2. The strengths and the sizes of all vortices are assumed to be the same throughout the entire prediction. Is it mostly the case in the real world? How does it introduce limitations to this model? Again, how to model the initial values using trainable vectors is unclear. Do they overfit to a certain example? If not, how are they estimated from the image?\n3. I wonder if this task can be achieved already by optimizing the parameters using differentiable fluid simulation:\nTakahashi, Tetsuya, et al. \"Differentiable fluids with solid coupling for learning and control.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vol. 35. No. 7. 2021.\nPlease add some discussions regarding the difference between the proposed method and the differentiable simulation system.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method to learn vortex dynamics from a single fluid video and thus be able to infer and predict fluid dynamics. At the core of the method are a Lagrangian vortex particle representation and a learnable vortex-to-velocity dynamics mapping. These two components can be trained merely from the observed video in an end-to-end manner. After training, the hidden physics quantities such as velocity field would be obtained, and the prediction of future states is also supported. The proposed method is compared with existing methods on both synthetic and real videos, where the proposed method shows more accurate velocity estimation and more plausible future prediction.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n- The proposed method of using a Lagrangian vortex particle representation and a learnable vortex-to-velocity mapping looks pretty interesting and reasonable to me. The vortex particle representation is more compact and reduces the problem's dimension. The learnable vortex-to-velocity mapping well connects the vortex particle and the fluid phenomena, making the pipeline end-to-end trainable. The model design also integrates fluid simulation and learning-based approach in a reasonable way, combining the advantages of both fields. \n\n- The advantage of the proposed method over baselines is obvious in experiments. Quantitative and qualitative study in synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed method estimates more accurate velocity and predicts more plausible future sequences.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The description of implementation is not detailed enough as some hyperparameters are missing. For example, the number of particles n is not provided. It is also not mentioned how $\\Delta$ and $\\Omega$ are initialized. Besides, it is suggested to also mention the efficiency of the method, like the training and inference time.\n\n- The amount of data used for evaluation seems limited. If I understand correctly, the quantitative study is conducted on only one synthetic video and one real video, which only covers limited diversity. It would be better to evaluate on more videos to strengthen the results.\n\n- The method now assumes inviscid fluid and 2-dimension, which is a somewhat constrained setting and would limit the application scope.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is clearly written and well organized.

            "summary_of_the_review": "I am not familiar with all the literature in this field, but to the best of my knowledge, this paper looks pretty interesting to me. It cleverly combines Lagrangian particle representation and Eular representation in a unified and end-to-end trainable framework, addressing several existing challenges. The parameterization of position x and the vortex-to-velocity mapping using neural networks is reasonable. But more implementation details could be added and the evaluation can be improved by using more videos. In general, I am in favor of accepting this paper. But it is possible that I may overlook some issues given my limited knowledge in this field, so I am also interested to see other reviewers' comments.",
