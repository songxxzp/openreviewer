In each of the tasks, the paper compares with strong baselines on large-scale datasets. Comprehensive ablation study is also provided to show the efficiency of the proposed module. The empirical study of the paper is strong and supports the claims of the paper well.\n\n2. The proposed module shows promising results when applied with different backbone architectures in various tasks, which demonstrates the usability of the method.\n\n3. The paper is well written and structured. Experimental details are elaborated.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Despite the comprehensive empirical study, I feel that the novelty of the proposed method might be a bit weak. The proposed method is an adaptation from a well studied method (RGConv) from the angle of efficiency. The technical depth might not be very strong. But I would not complain much as similarity might be a factor that the method can be applied in various tasks.\n\n2.  The construction of the graphs may require additional tuning such as the number of KNN. It is also a bit heuristic as it is constructed by some predefined rules (although it can be dynamic with the learning of the model). Moreover, although the paper claims \"spatial\", I feel that it does not apply specific configurations to deal with \"spatial\" and \"spatial\" is just one of the predefined relations.",
