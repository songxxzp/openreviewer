Specific constraints are introduced and the problem is formulated a constrained optimization problem. An ADMM algorithm is derived to compute the factorization solution. Performance comparison with some existing methods have been presented and the way of using the proposed method to interpret the meta-factors extracted from the questionnaires' results was illustrated.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ The application scenario is clearly presented.\n+ The problem is clearly formulated in general.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The key contribution of the paper is not clear. As mentioned in the paper, there are different alternatives to organize the multiple questionnaire data matrices for the factorization. It seems that performance gained in terms of ROC-AUC together with the interpretability is due to the application of constraints to factor values and reconstructed matrices. Is it not clear what happen if similar tricks are applied to the setting with the questionnaire data matrices concatenated. Also, the way to handle missing values and the use of ADMM for constrained optimisation is not new. Overall speaking, the novelty in term of algorithm is considered incremental.\n- It seems that the interpretability could be related to the control of the sparsity as discussed in Section 3.1. I noticed only that the values of p and q for controlling the sparsity are set to be 1. There seems no more investigation on sparsity afterwards.\n\nQuestion:\nIn Section 3.1, regarding continuous confound, if one wants to consider different ranges of value, will the mirroring procedure be sufficient?\n\nSome typos\n* The variables p and q are used twice to denote different concepts, sparsity control and row and column shuffling in BCV (Section 3.1). \n* The mask defined in ICQF is not the same as the mask defined in 3.3, but the same notation is used.",

In the situation that there are multiple questionnaires, a meta-factorization is proposed in this paper by first factorizing each questionnaire, and then perform a second factorization on the concatenation of all first-step factor matrices. Numerical experiment has been performed on real questionnaires.",

The choice of cross validation seems appropriate. Theoretical guarantees for the convergence of algorithm have been provided.\n- Numerical experiments show significant advantage over existing methods.\n\nQuestions: \n- For meta-factorization, is it necessary to have equal number of participants $n$ for all questionnaires? Otherwise, it seems one can\u2019t concatenate all factor matrices like in Eq. (6). If so, I wonder how one can relax this constraint? Because in practice, the number of participants may not be the same for each questionnaire due to non-compliance, so requiring the number of participants to be the same could be unrealistic.\n- As a follow-up to the last question about meta-factorization, I wonder if the sets of respondents have to be the same for all questionnaires? In practice, they may be different due to non-compliance or missing data. Some participants who answered questionnaire A may not answer questionnaire B. \n- About the optimization problem (ICQF), Contribution 2 mentioned: \u201cif this number of factors is close to that underlying the data, the solution will be close to a global minimum\u201d. Could \u201cthe number of factor of the underlying data\u201d be more explicitly defined? In practice, I wonder which optimization problem is more non-convex, harder to reach a global minimum and more numerical unstable: the one with number of factors over-estimated or the one with number of factors under-estimated.\n",

Therefore, reporting ROC-AUC (which is mainly used for binary classification) in Table 1 and Figure 3 may not be an appropriate method of evaluating the proposed method.

The proposed method could be compared with other techniques in terms of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).\n\n5) In Figures 1 and 2, why validation errors are reported rather than test errors?\n\n6) In Figure 1 Bottom Right, what is X axis metric? What are the upper and lower bounds for this axis? \n\n7) The current format of Figure 1 Top is not informative.
