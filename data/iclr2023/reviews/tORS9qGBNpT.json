They study the convergence of pairwise ranking using distributed learning and random features (DRank-RF) via both theoretical assessments and numerical experiments.\n2. They claim that prior work in distributed learning mainly focuses on pointwise kernel learning, and the existing work for pointwise kennel learning suffers from high computational requirements. This work explores the efficient way of doing distributed pairwise ranking kernel learning by combining distributed learning and random features for pairwise ranking kernel learning.\n3. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are conducted. They derive the convergence rate of the proposed method, which is sharper than that of the existing state-of-the-art distributed pairwise ranking kernel learning.\n4. They propose a communication strategy to further improve the performance of DRank-RF, called DRank-RF-C.\n",
