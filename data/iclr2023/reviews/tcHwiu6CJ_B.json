            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper tackles the problem of improving the accuracy of semantic segmentation on long-tail classes. To this end, it introduces separate heads to the network output that focus only on specific segments of the class distribution, which are grouped heuristically into \u201chead\u201d, \u201cbody\u201d and \u201ctail\u201d categories, based on their frequency in the dataset. A few decoder layers are trained to aggregate the predictions from these heads into the final model prediction. This approach improves the mean pixel accuracy across classes, but mIoU stays largely the same.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- I concur with the authors that the long-tail problem in recognition deserves more research.\n- The proposed approach is intuitive in its intention and improves the mean accuracy.\n- Experiments with multiple model architectures and datasets.\n- The reference numbers for the oracle scenario are interesting.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nI understand that the approach does not pan out in terms of the IoU, hence the need to push mAcc as the more important metric. The work provides some formal argument, which I do not find convincing, however. The interpretation of the results \u2014 mAcc improves, mIoU does not \u2014 has a simple explanation to me: the method reduces the number of false negatives at the cost of increasing the number of false positives. I do not consider this is an overall improvement.\n\nSome technical steps are not explained to a sufficient extent:\n- The discussion leading up to Eq. 4 is unclear. What norm is imposed on z and why this need? What is the \u201creality\u201d data distribution?\n\nThe notation has many loose ends, which impedes understanding of the actual implementation:\n- In Eq. 4 the sum scope is unclear;\n- The second line above Eq. 6: the condition for y membership is unclear, because the sets S are disjoint, as defined above.\n\nSome of the claims are not backed up:\n- Second line after Eq. 5: \u201cK experts are good and distinctive from each other\u201d \u2014 how are the goodness and distinctiveness measured?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Some arguments need fine-tuning to improve the clarity and quality in the paper, especially when it comes to formalizing them. Another example to the ones above is the last paragraph on page 4: X and Y should be apparently defined as a tuple (X, Y), but the definition of Y as a sample-agnostic label set is confusing. \n- There is limited novelty in this work. The approach to process groups of categories with a standalone classifier is a common theme in the literature on long-tail recognition.\n- The implementation details seem sufficient for reproducibility.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The empirical results do not show a significant improvement in terms of mIoU, which accounts for false positives and false negatives. The argument that mAcc is a more important measure is not convincing, since one would need to consider a very specific scenario of a downstream task for semantic segmentation. Since we commonly study semantic segmentation in an application-agnostic way, mIoU remains an important metric even if the focus is on the long-tail categories.",

The ablation is comprehensive to cover the main contribution of this paper\n\nWeakness\n\n1. What is the contextual module? It needs to be illustrated with more details.\n\n2. The auxiliary loss is unclear to me. What is the reality distribution 'q'. I do not quite understand this comment 'It is inevitable that we need to classify these pixels, even if they fall into majority categories'. From my understanding, for experts that process body or tail categories, these majority categories can be ignored without causing any gradient. In equation 4, the auxiliary loss tends to minimize the logits for these classes, which needs more explanation. In summary, the role played by this loss is quite confusing.\n\n3. I have a big concern about the effectiveness of the proposed method. In table 2, the performance of the proposed method is even worse than the baseline. Despite the oracle results are promising, it is not applicable since we cannot priorly know which expert should process which pixel. For table 4, I can see some improvement for the rare classes on cityscapes, but the improvement is also quite minor. I admit the improvement on ADE20k is interesting, but only obtaining good results on one dataset is not enough to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. \n\n4. The paper divides the categories into three sets. But during training, the experts process some overlapped categories. Why does the author device such an architecture instead of letting each expert work on a separate class set.\n\n5. The author only compare their method to the straight baseline. It is okay but it would be better if it can comprehensively compare the method to the SOTA long-tail techniques used in semantic segmentation.",
