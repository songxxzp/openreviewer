The authors propose a framework called Active Learning based Structural Inference (ALaSI). The authors design inter- and out-of-scope operations to make ALaSI scalable, and evaluate the framework on many datasets. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed framework.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. While I'm not an expert on structural inference in dynamic systems, the proposed inter- and out-of-scope operations look interesting and novel. These operations help make the proposed framework scalable to large dynamic systems.\n2. The authors run experiments on multiple datasets and compare ALsSI with multiple baselines. The proposed method outperforms all existing baselines on all datasets.\n\nWeakness: Besides the proposed inter- and out-of-scope operations, other tricks, e.g., the hybrid loss and PID, studied in the paper seem to be standard to the literature or at least very intuitive.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "This paper is well-written and generally easy to follow.

I have read the response and would like to keep my scores. I also suggest the authors add more explanations to the paper to make it more readable (e.g., backgrounds/explanations on PID).",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors explore a novel problem structural inference in active learning. They proposed ALaSI to infer the existing connections in the dynamic system in both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The ALaSI can distinguish inter and out of scope information and its loss is built on three goals \ni) motivating model to extract OOS representations, \nii) computing dynamic error,\nand iii) estimating the connectivity prediction error. \nThe experiment results on seven dynamic systems show that ALaSI can infer the connection better than the state-of-the-art methods.\nBut the paper is not well written, lacking of consistency and clarification.\n ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n1.\tThe authors explore a novel problem in active learning. \n2.\tThe authors consider the problem comprehensively. They scale to large data size and the loss can help learn OOS representation, estimating dynamic error and connectivity prediction error.\n\nWeakness\n1.\tThis paper is not well written and not self-contained. A lot of jargons are used without definition or clarification, such as inter and out scope, pool, query with dynamics. \n\n2.\tThe loss of ALaSI is complicated with four parts, and each part has its own tuning parameter. The paper does not provide a good strategy to tune the alpha, beta, gamma and eta, which will make it hard to search an optimal combination of the parameters. The authors should report ablation results to convince the reader that each part of the loss plays an important role.\n\n3.\tThe authors only show the results of the link prediction, which is not sufficient for structural inference. The authors should plot a figure showing that the predicted trajectory is closed to the ground truth, like in other papers such as NRI, fNRI, ACD. \n\n4.\tWhile titled active learning based structural inference, this paper is light on the active learning part. Only section 4.4 briefly covered AL.  There is not sufficient details to understand how the AL works with the rest system. \n\n5.\tThe authors do not show whether the ALaSI method is robust to noisy data. And the performance under different noise level.\n\n6.\tMinor: in figure 2, the second figure in the first row, why does the AUROC decrease between 0.3 and 0.5 proportion of labeled connection? With more proportion of labeled data, the AUROC should increase. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\nThis work is not self-contained (see weakness 5) and is difficult to follow. For example, PID (partial information decomposition) is an important concept in section 3, but the authors start to explain it very late in section 4.5. What are the model parameters in equation 1? Why choose this particular form? How does this connect to equation 4? \n\nQuality\nThis loss of the ALaSI is complicated and I am also concerned how this method works on trajectory prediction. I think this will make the method more convincing.\n\nNovelty\nStructural Inference is not new, but it is a novel problem in active learning.\n\nReproducibility\nThe algorithm is clear in the appendix, but the authors do not provide how they set the parameters and the hyper parameters, such as learning rate, hidden dimensions, network layers, etc.\n",
