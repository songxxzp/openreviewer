For example, in Definition 1, what do you mean by $S_i \\times \\hat{U}_i$ being a ''subspace'' of the joint state-action space $S_i \\times U_i$? According to your later wording $S_i\\times \\hat{U}_i\\subset S\\times U$, you seems to mean ''subset'' instead of subspace. However, if you are using ''subset'' and ''subspace'' interchangeably, then the relation in the first bullet point in Definition 1 makes no sense at all. \n\nGetting extremely confused with Definition 1, I referred to the original definition of decomposable MG in Dou et al., 2022 (which is also cited in Definition 1 by this submission) and found it mathematically sound and also much clearer. I do not see how the submission invented this wrong definition but still attributed it to Dou et al., 2022. Also, the place where the submission cited (Dou et al., 2022) is wrong. It should be immediately after Decomposable Markov Game instead of Markov games.\n\nThere are tons of typos and vague claims in the submission.

With respect to which policy? The optimal policy or any policy?\n3. In Equation (1), you write $Q_i(\\tau_i,u_i)$ but below you write $Q_i(u_i,\\tau_i)$\n4. what do you mean by \"The IGM principle enables the coordination of local policies under the centralized trained joint Q value function\"\n5. what do you mean by \"As a result, the optimal Bellman operator could be not a \u03b3\u2212constraint (Wang et al., 2020a) when faced with non-linear true Q value functions. In words, there could be multiple convergences for the joint Q value function (Wan et al., 2021) and the policy would get trapped in sub-optimums.\" Please explain what is \u03b3\u2212constraint otherwise what's the meaning of adding this sentence here?

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strength:\n* The paper makes several nice technical contributions:\n1. The paper first identifies the equivalence between linear function factorization and decomposability of the Markov game, thus motivating the study on indecomposable Markov game and non-linear function factorization.\n2. The paper identifies the form of extended LVF and argues that one should use the parameterized module form of NVF in order for ensuring IGM and CRC conditions. \n3. The paper identifies the representation interference issues in NVF and proposed the new algorithm QFRIS to mitigate this issue. \n4. The experiments seem convincing in terms that the results match the theory in the synthetic environment and it achieves competitive performance in the standard benchmarks.\n* The paper (main paper + appendix) seems relatively complete, and the technical results seem correct.\n\n# Weakness\n* I am having a hard time understanding what is the main message of the paper: section 3 seems a motivation for why we should focus on NVF and section 4 seems to identify how to design NVF that achieves both IGM and CRC. My understanding is that these previous sections serve as motivation for the main algorithm QFRIS, but the methodology section seems pretty short and I am also confused why the benchmark results are deferred to the appendix. Is the empirical success of QFRIS not an important message that the paper tries to deliver? In particular, I am confused about the functionality of several parts of the paper: \n1. Section 2.1: why do we introduce POMDP? Do the following sections specifically deal with partial observation? \n2. What is the motivation of introducing Lemma 1?\n3. And what is the significance of the extended LVF?\n* The definition of CRC condition seems vague to me and the proof for some form satisfying CRC seems quite handwavy, but I may miss its connection to some of the formal definitions and arguments. \n* The writing of the paper needs some refinement. There are several typos and undefined notations in the current version and some of them requires the readers to guess what the paper really wants to say at some point, for example:\n  * In Eq. (1), should $s$ be bold because the above section mentions global variables are bold?\n  * typo in the subscript $u^1$ in Eq. (2).\n  * Again *u_{t+1}* is not bold under the expectation in Eq. (5).\n  * What does it in by optimal trajectory under Eq. (6)? Does it only make sense in deterministic system?\n  * The last sentence in the first paragraph in section 4 seems incomplete?\n  * Is $u_{gre}$ defined the same way on $\\mathcal{M}$ as it is defined on $Q$?\n  * What does the subscript in the Q function, for example, $Q_{33}$ in the synthetic environment mean?\n  * The figure reference numbers do not seem correct.\n* I am not fully convinced by the following argument made under proposition 1: \"The joint Q value function of LVF is capable to represent the true Q value function only if each decomposed Markov game of the MGD involves only a single agent.\" For example, how do you define the reward in the synthetic markov game when it is decomposed to one with only one agent?\n* The main text has quite a few discontinuities in the arguments, not just the proofs. For example, it would be better to have at least some overview in section 4.2 on why introducing parametrized functions directly suffers poor convergence, instead of throwing everything into the appendix.
