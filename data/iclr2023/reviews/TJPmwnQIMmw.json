The authors claim that the existing works mainly focus on the OOD issue of correlation shift, while another type, covariate shift, remains largely unexplored. Then, a graph augmentation strategy called AdvCA is proposed to handle the covariate shift problem with an adversarial augmenter and a causal generator. Experimental results show that the proposed AdvCA can outperform several baselines.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:   \n1. The OOD generalization problem of graph machine learning is an important and trending research topic. I appreciate the authors' efforts in formalizing the problem and proposing necessary assumptions for graph covariate shifts.  \n2. The authors propose a causal framework to formulate the problem and guide the graph augmentation.  \n3.  Both synthetic and real datasets are used to show the empirical effectiveness of the proposed approach.   \n\nCons:  \nHowever, I have some concerns:  \n1. The main concern is regarding technical novelty. I think the problem formulation is similar to previous works, e.g., EERM (Wu et al., ICLR 2022a), so the formulation should not be considered a particular contribution. The authors claim that the existing graph generalization efforts cannot guarantee both environmental diversity and causal invariance, but EERM has explored these key concepts and its formulation for ego-graphs can be straightforwardly extended to the graph-level tasks.   \n2. The proposed method is somehow incremental and thus the technical contribution of the paper is limited. In particular:  \n(1) The idea of adversarial data augmentation is similar to EERM. More comparisons and discussions regarding related works are expected to further clarify the novelty of the proposed method.   \n(2) The authors claim that the existing works cannot guarantee environmental diversity while the proposed AdvCA can. However, why AdvCA can increase diversity than augmentation-based baseline methods such as GREA is not clearly discussed.   \n3. The experiments are not convincing enough. The experimental results of baselines seem to be inconsistent with the results in the original papers. The details regarding the hyper-parameters of baselines are not clearly present, which raises potential concerns in fair comparisons. The visualizations should also consider some baselines to verify whether AdvCA finds causal parts more accurately than baselines.  \n4. I would also suggest the authors proofread Figure 2 since the plotted environmental features are identical and not diverse.  \n\n",
