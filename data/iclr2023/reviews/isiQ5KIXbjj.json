            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a new approach for learning QUBO formulation for problems to be solved on quantum annealers using machine learning in comparison to previous work on quantum computer vision that relied on hand-crafted QUBO formulations. The paper proposes learning to regress a coefficient matrix for QUBO using contrastive loss based on the energies of solutions found the quantum annealer (or other QUBO solvers). Experiments on different computer vision problems show competitive results with previous quantum SOTA while requiring fewer qubits.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* Innovative approach for learning QUBO formulations of problems to be solved on quantum annealers.\n* Unlike previous work on quantum computer vision, the proposed approach is general and not problem-specific.\n* Experiments on graph matching and point set alignment show the approach is competitive with previous quantum SOTA approaches while requiring fewer qubits.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n* Learned QUBO can be more sensitive to distribution shift than hand-crafted QUBO design in SOTA approaches. While the noise experiments are interesting it would be valuable to design experiments to compare the proposed approach and the hand-crafted QUBO approaches in terms of generalization to out-of-distribution test instances.\n* Learned QUBO formulations can be less interpretable compared to hand-crafted QUBO formulations. In particular, when designing QUBO we often convert problem constraints to penalty terms in the objective. Knowing the penalty terms and their weight can provide some guarantees on the obtained solutions with respect to the satisfaction of domain-specific constraints. While learning QUBO may involve implicitly learning such constraints from data, we have no way of knowing what constraints have been learnt (in human-understandable mathematical notation as often done in the hand-crafted QUBO formulations).\n* Experiments do not show significant gains in performance over SOTA. However, I think that obtaining competitive results using fewer qubits and in a problem-independent approach is impressive.\n\nMinor question: How did you create mini-batches for training? Did you accumulate the results of multiple runs with the QA hardware into mini-batches?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The paper is clear and well-written and the approach seems novel and innovative.\n\n- Reproducibility: the appendices seem to provide the information needed for reproducing the results including the NN and training implementation details and the encoding of the different problems. The supplementary material contains problem instances. Code is not provided with the submission however the authors mention it will be released.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I think this is an interesting paper that presents a novel and innovative approach with good experimental results. The main weaknesses include the fact that such formulations are learned and may therefore not generalize well or maintain similar guarantees as hand-crafted QUBO formulations, as well as the relatively modest gains in performance compared to SOTA. Despite the weaknesses, I think this is a nice contribution to the research on quantum computer vision (with potential impact beyond computer vision due to the generality of the approach).",

It learns a low-energy formulation of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems with multilayer perceptron and gradient backpropagation, instead of problem-specific analytical derivations.  After learning a QUBO form, they solve it with existing quantum annealing techniques. Their model excels previous models on some benchmarks both in computational expenditure and performance.\n\nChallenge: \n\nDepth: A new training strategy for neural methods with backpropagation, independent of the solver.\nResults:\n-Task: graph matching, 2D point cloud alignment, and 3D rotation estimation.\n-Metric: Accuracy, and the number of qubits of the forms obtained by the proposed algorithms.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n- The idea of finding the forms of QUBO with gradient is interesting.\n- A wide variety of problems can be tackled successfully and competitively by the proposed general quantum approach.\n- The proposed algorithm finds formulation with fewer qubits than state-of-the-art.\n\nCons:\n- The selected baselines are not strong enough. It is not clear how the selected baselines, Diag and Pure measure the quality of the solution. The author should compare to state-of-the-art.\n- The comparisons with specialized methods are limited. \n- The synthetic data are relatively small, e.g., random matrix 4 by 4 and 5 by 5. ",

Nonetheless, it is commendable to take a general problem by learning its form and transforming it into the ones we have solutions to (rather than attempting to solve it directly).",
            "summary_of_the_review": "About Challenge:\n- Obtaining suitable QUBO forms in computer vision remains challenging and currently requires problem-specific analytical derivations.\n- The MLP is trained with the results from AQM, resulting in its performance bounded by AQM. Given such deficiency, is it really fair to conclude that QUBO learning is capable to deal with a general problem?\n- The results are not impressive. Their MLP surprisingly fails to beat binary regression (\u201cpure\u201d) in some cases. Is it an isolated incident that QUBO learning beats some SOTA? \n\nAbout Contribution:\n-The paper contributes to the area by looking beyond the traditional approach of deriving and solving QUBO from a specific problem. It addresses a bigger picture concerning how to identify and classify a mission. By aiming at generality, it extends the application of quantum annealing as well.",
