However, the original work on DDIMs [1] appear to contradict this claim: [1] states that DDIMs are probability flow ODEs of the variance exploding diffusion SDE as described in [2]. \n\nProposition 3 states that Eq. 13 holds when the data is a Dirac distribution for a single data point. However, Thm 1 assumes that Eq. 13 is approximately true for general data.

The authors build up their insights using a toy dataset consisting of only one data point, in which the parameterization of DDIM can produce smooth network output along trajectories and thus enable large step size to achieve sampling acceleration. Then this insight is generalized to real dataset by considering the manifold hypothesis and a mixture of Dirac distributions. As an application of this framework, authors first rewrite non-isotropic BDM and CLD into gDDIMs and show the acceleration achieved by the smoothed estimation along the trajectory.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1. The analysis toward understanding why DDIM accelerates the sampling process is well organized and inspiring. Following that, because complexity can be decomposed into simple cases, extending and interpreting the results in real datasets is natural. (even though in a less rigorous way) The research methodology is of merit, starting from a clear analysis of the simple and synthetic case and finally carefully verifying this on realistic datasets.\n2. Given the fact that authors train an adjusted CLD, (which is not training free to achieve the best results), the final results are pretty good.\n\nWeaknesses/Concerns:\n\n1. To apply the acceleration techniques, one first needs to formulate irregular diffusion models into a regular form provided by this paper and make a correspondence between less structured generalized diffusion model designs with parameters and formulations in this framework, which incurs an invisible bar for many practitioners. This is somehow not an off-the-shelf acceleration method.\n2. Authors spend a notable portion explaining the hyperparameters in CLD and the correspondence between the original CLD and newly designed in this paper, like the $L_t$ and $R_t$. In this case, the gDDIM is not a training free method. To achieve the best acceleration, training from scratch is necessary, which actually changes the model design for CLD.\n3. The writing of the introduction can be polished much further. Without good logical guidance, it is a bit confusing for readers to see many less structured references to the method section. The authors should compress the related works in the introduction, move this part to the related works, and use the additional space here to organize and present the *logic* of this paper.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n1. Related works should be presented in the main paper.\n2. The definition of $L_t$ should be introduced earlier in the main paper, as this is discussed and compared in the experiments but not clearly stated.\n3. It should be $N$ score evaluation in Table 8, not $n$ score evaluation.",
