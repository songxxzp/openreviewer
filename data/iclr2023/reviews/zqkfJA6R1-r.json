It provides examples where PINNs circumvent the instability of the EIT problem, it creates a data-driven energy-based model to improve the accuracy of the EIT reconstruction. The problem is not only mathematically interesting but has a significant practical use in multiple domains, not least in medicine.\n\nCareful analysis is done on the different regularisation methods. These  show that viable solutions are found with regularisation. The traditional solutions are computed for comparison with different degrees of noise. ",

For example, DSM always may require a large-scale dataset for training, but the paper \u201cgenerates 6512 such smoothed phantoms for EBM prior training and 1628 for testing.\u201d How can the author decide this is a sufficient dataset to train the EBM prior. Moreover, the distribution captured by EBM prior is always dependent on the training data. How could the trained EBM prior generalize to other cases or how easy is it to train an adaptive EBM prior for different application cases?\n- The paper mentions that \u201c training of PINN is extremely sensitive to interplay between different loss terms and hyper-parameters, including the learning rate.\u201d But for the proposed method, as shown in Eq. (11) as well as the training of EBM prior, there are still many hyper-parameters that need to be decided. Although Sec. 4.4 shows that with EBM prior, the model seems to have a higher training success rate, the training of EBM prior also depends on the different hyper-parameters choices and may also raise other problems during the training. How practical it could be to choose a reasonable set of hyper-parameters when generalized to different application cases?\n- The paper conducts all the experiments on the simulation data. Is there any real dataset that could be used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real applications? Especially, for the real data, is it still possible to get a decent scale of dataset to train the EBM prior and how efficient is it?\n-For comparison among different baseline methods, beyond the quantitative results shown in Table 2, can the paper also provide the qualitative results comparison? It would be interesting how these methods may distinguish in the real application?\n- The idea of combining PINN and DSM prior for solving inverse problems is interesting. The author introduces this mainly from the perspective of PINN and  solving the EIT inverse problem as in Sec. 5. There are also a series of researches recently for using DSM models for inverse problem solving such as medical image reconstruction by incorporating physics priors. How could this paper be relevant to those line of research also for inverse problem solving?\n- In Table 2, the paper citations of titles are all missing?\n\n",
