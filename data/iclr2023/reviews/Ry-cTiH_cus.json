Their observation seems that the dimension of the feature maps associated with quantum kernels is exponential but can be processed by quantum boxes. The problem with these kernel is that their leading eigenvalues are too small so that these models do not generalize well. The authors then observe that if one change the ``bandwidth\u2019\u2019 of these kernel functions, then distribution of the eigenvalues becomes more benign. I am not sure whether I interpret the result correctly, but it appears that the authors provide analysis for one specific kernel (with closed forms) and argued that tuning bandwidth could be beneficial for other kernels. \n\nThe paper is quite well written and provided careful exposition to both kernel learning and quantum computing (I was able to follow more than 50% of the paper). The results also appear to be quite significant, especially in a new area. I am leaning towards acceptance.\n\n\nIs the number of cubits needed the same as the dimension of the data? That sounds quite painful? \nFor the problem analyzed (eq. 5), because the kernel can be explicitly written, what\u2019s the reason that this kernel cannot be solved by classical computers? \nIn the experiment, it was stated that pre-computed kernels are used. But if kernel bandwidth needs to be tuned, wouldn\u2019t that just mean pre-computed values could be mostly irrelevant? \n",
