            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers adversarial robustness in the communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning setting (CMARL), where $N$ agents communicate with each other.\nAt each step, an agent observes (their part) of the environment, receives messages from the other $N-1$ agents, and proposes an action.\nThe thread model considered in this paper assumes that for an (arbitrary) individual agent up to $C \\leq \\frac{N-1}{2}$ of the received messages can be arbitrarily changed. This setting is formalized and a certifiable defense, AME, for it is proposed.\n\nAME utilizes a random ablation approach, as proposed in [1]: the action is determined as the aggregate over the output of an arbitrary underlying policy evaluated on $D$ randomly sampled subsets of the received messages.\nEach subset is of size $k \\leq N-1$, where the parameter $k$ controls a trade-off between high robustness ($k$ low) and high performance ($k=N-1$; the standard underlying algorithm). The aggregation operation depends on whether continuous or discrete actions are considered.\n\nAME is evaluated in different CMARL environments, where AME (usually) reduces the performance when no adversary is present.\nHowever, in case an adversary is present AME indeed outperforms standard and adversarial trianing. \n\n[1] Robustness certificates for sparse adversarial attacks by randomized ablation, Alexander Levine and Soheil Feizi, AAAI20\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths:**\n- Strong and relevant attacker model.\n- Simple, well-motivated certifiable defense.\n- Mathematical details appear to be sound.\n- Thorough evaluation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The paper does not discuss the robustness certificate in depth (although the appendix does). Generally, I feel, the paper might benefit from including more from appendices B and C in the main paper (at the cost of shortening some other discussion).\n- While the evaluation is thorough, Section 6 was hard to follow (as it required a lot of going back and forth between multiple paragraphs and Figure 3).\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "**Clarity and Presentation**\nOverall the paper is clearly written and can easily be followed.\nI think the presentation could be improved by including at least Algorithm 2 in the main paper.\n\n**Reproducibility**\nAs the AME approach is relatively simple, it should be straightforward to re-implement. However, to recover the exact experiments, I encourage the authors to provide their code to the eventual readers.\n\n**Further Questions**\nSome small questions, that remained after reading:\n- I assume that in the evaluation all agents employ AME. Is this the case? It would be potentially interesting to see settings where an AME agent interacts with Vanilla ones. Can you comment on this setting?\n- You discuss the importance of redundancy in the observation for AME to work well. I could imagine that there are cases in which some information is only observed by one (or very few) agent(s). Can you further quantify or discuss this aspect?\n\n**Minor Formatting/Typos**\n- The citation style after MARL-MNIST and Traffic Junction is inconsistent (page 8).\n\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This manuscript introduces a new setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication, where the communication could be attacked in several ways. The message could be alternated, the agents who send the messages could be hacked, and such attacks could happen in multiple places and could be adaptive to the receiver agent. To address this, the manuscript proposes a pretty much *general* solution, which is based on a message aggregation strategy. It basically guarantees that the receiver receives multiple messages and works on the ensemble of them, in a way that if some messages are attacked in some way, the aggregation still gives the close-to-true value. The manuscript claims that if the number of attacked messages is less than half then the action is to some extent \"safe\". The manuscript also did some simulations.\n\nThe method is a consensus-based aggregator, which trains a base policy that uses $k$ out of $n$ messages from the sender agents. At test time $k$ messages are sampled from all messages to compute the output and this process is repeated for multiple times. The median of the outputs is used as the final output. This method is quite intuitive.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pro:\n\n1. The manuscript investigates an interesting problem and the problem is indeed relevant in a variety of applications.\n\n2. The authors have spent an effort to illustrate the proposed method from multiple aspects, including some theoretical derivation, some simulations, and the intuition underlying the method.\n\n3. Experiments are conducted in multiple tasks.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The guarantee of the \"certifiable robustness\" is very general and is not strong enough. I'm wondering if certain bounds on robustness and utility could be proved in concrete examples.\n\n2. The setting that an agent receives $n$ messages is not realistic in many tasks, like SMAC. It is unlikely that all messages from $n$ agents are (equally) useful so in practice an attack on an important message could do more damage than the paper guaranteed. ",
