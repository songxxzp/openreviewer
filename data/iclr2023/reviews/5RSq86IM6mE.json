They consider the tasks of segmentation of white matter Multiple Sclerosis lesions in 3D magnetic resonance brain images and the estimation of power consumption in marine cargo vessels. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:**\n- Any well maintained dataset is very welcome and needed by the community. \n- The dataset/task that has been suggested are also important and relevant,  as the importance of dataset shift in higher-risk application is becoming more clear for the AI community.\n- The paper is clearly written, and provided a detailed appendix.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The author suggests a permanent leaderboard on grand-challenge as the evaluation set for the brain MRI task, and mentioned it will be possible to evaluate models on it via dockers. No details for further exploration or readiness of such a system are provided to be reviewed by reviewers.\n- Using a docker for evaluation can become challenging very fast. I personally prefer .csv submission and I think their are more convenient as it has been used by WILDS leaderboard (https://wilds.stanford.edu/submit/#making-a-submission).\n- All of the MRI data is collected in Europe so, there is neither ethnicity related nor disease prevalence shift in the proposed data, and major acquisition or protocol shift would not be observed. Only the scanner type has been changed from one setting to another. However, at least for developing an effective medical image analysis system disease prevalence shift and shifts related to ethnicity are far more important and less explored. \n- There is no discussion around patient attribution and metadata related to fairness. Specifically for the medical applications, and in a new setting, one major concern is methods fairness and running the proper sub-group analysis is required. Without any relevant meta-data such as ethnicity this is not feasible. [There is a limited discussion around gender/age and tumor size change between sets which is not sufficient and the paper does not provide any effective insight or evaluation.]\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The paper is very well-written and clear.\n- The application data provided  is not necessarily novel and not the first.\n- There is no reproducibility concern as they (will) provide open access data and leader-board.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Contributions around creating of well-maintained and large-scale distribution shift dataset are important and largely welcomed within the community, however, at least for the medical application side, it lacks further evaluation and expansion to provide subgroup meta-data details and addresses concerns related to fairness. Indeed most of the concerns in such a novel and shifted setup are around fairness and performance of this method in sub-groups and long-tails. ",

The paper also discusses the potential applications/use cases of the datasets.\n3. The datasets are well documented with all the necessary details including license and user agreements. \n\nWeakness(es)/Suggestion(s):\n1. It would be nice to compare the brain MRI dataset with existing MS lesion dataset(s) (like MICCAI's MS dataset). Similarly, if available, please do the same for the power consumption tabular dataset.\n2. Although it is good to have an exhaustive appendix, it would be a little hard for the readers to switch back and forth between the main text and the appendix. I'm not sure if the appendix can be part of the main paper. If it can, it would ease reading as the hyperlink to appendices would work.\n3. Since the authors are hosting a Grande Challenge with a leaderboard, would the evaluation criteria be the same as the one's mentioned in Table 2 (for the segmentation dataset) and Table 3 (for the tabular dataset)?",

Building a benchmark to study distribution shift is an important topic and introducing the medical image and real industrial problem into this benchmark is useful. \n2. The authors propose to evaluate both the robustness and uncertainty is reasonable for me. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. After reading this paper, I am not very clear about the contribution of this paper (including both empirical novelty and technical novelty), especially compared with the previous work shifts Datasets. For me, the two new things are introducing two new datasets and introducing the concept of \"both evaluating accuracy and robustness.\" However, the medical image dataset is a public dataset, and there are also several similar works to study \"domain generalization\" for medical images, like cardiac image segmentation (https://www.ub.edu/mnms/ and https://www.ub.edu/mnms-2/). For the second one, as the authors mentioned, this dataset is very similar to the weather prediction one in the original shifts Datasets.  It seems that there are not too many \"new things\" in this paper.\n\n2. The authors want to benchmark the current ML algorithms assessing robustness and uncertainty, while it seems that the author only evaluates some baseline methods, not comprehensively comparing them with various methods. The major contribution is limited to introducing these two different datasets.\n\n3. For the evaluation of uncertainty, I am not clear whether it is really \"uncertainty.\" If my understanding is correct, it is to evaluate the prediction probability (or something like that). I am not sure if it is proper to mention that as \"uncertainty.\"\n\n4. Some previous uncertainty estimations works may need to be mentioned as related work.\n",
