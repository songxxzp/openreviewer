As an accuracy predictor, DDSAR-Score measures the quality of sampled backbone architectures stage-wise, which is beneficial to apply the neural architecture search (NAS) technique to FD. ",

From the reported experimental results, the usefulness of DDSAR-Score can be confirmed.\nWeaknesses: \n1.\tThe literature review related to NAS should be enriched.\n2.\tThe explanation of formulae should be improved. For example, what does $\\circ $ mean in the definition of ${{\\mathcal{F}}_{\\mathcal{N}}}\\left( {{x}^{0}};\\theta  \\right)$?\n3.\tThe strategy for selecting weights in Section 4.2 is described as shallow.\n4.\tIs the selection of the evolutionary architecture search algorithm a limitation of your work? In other words, can any other search algorithms work? \n5.\tHow do you define the network search space?\n6.\tTesting data could be enriched.\n7.\tMore methods should be chosen to testify to your method, especially the latest ones.\n8.\tReference should be updated.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studied how to search for a lightweight backbone network for face detection using NAS. The key is how to develop stage-aware accuracy predictors of face detection performance for different network architectures. Thus, the paper derived a new stage-aware ranking score from the expressivity of ReLU CNNs, i.e., the lower bound of the maximal number of linear regions, from previous works (e.g., Xiong et al. 2020). Specifically, the paper proposed 1) a stage-aware expressivity score (Eq.4) by removing stage-irrelevant items and adding a fully-connected layer to combine multiple layers; and 2) calibrating the weights (Eq.8) to combine the ranking scores across multiple stages by a dataset with groundtruths and a Resnet50 backbone. The proposed ranking scores, i.e., DDSAR-Score, is integrated in an evolutionary architecture search. This method has been evaluated on the Wider Face dataset and compared favorably with recent NAS methods for face detection.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Face detection has been extensively studied in decades with many commercial face detectors running on embedded systems. Search for a lightweight backbone network for face detection using NAS is an interesting and well-motivated topic. The proposed DDSAR-Score reasonably integrates the expressivity of multi-stage ReLU CNNs, which is somewhat novel and empirically works well in an evolutionary architecture search. \n\nThe proposed stage-aware ranking score approximates the expressivity by the lower bound of the maximal number of linear regions, which is fine. The major concern is the gap between the expressivity of ReLU CNN and the face detection performance, e.g. detection rate and false positive rate. Please discuss more about the relation between the network expressivity and detection performance.\n\nAnother concern is the generality of the proposed DDSAR-Score, which is derived from the expressivity of ReLU CNNs in previous works. How to extend DDSAR-Score to other network architectures?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The major contribution is to derive the ranking score for \\emph{multi-stage} networks from the expressivity of ReLU CNNs, which is modest novel.

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this is a descent paper addressing a well-motivated problem. The proposed stage-aware expressivity score is new and works well.
