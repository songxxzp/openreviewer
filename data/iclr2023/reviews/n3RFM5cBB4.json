            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to jointly formulate particle and continuum for model multi-scale, non-equilibrium, and no-body physical systems. Specifically,  this model contains three components, 1) a classical solver for kinetic particles, 2) a neural network for the evolution of thermal sub-population with fluid representation, and 3) an injection neural network from a fluid state to a particle state. \n\nCompared with existing methods on non-equilibrium, and no-body physical systems, it uses the hybrid representation instead of the uniform representation. Though the method is simple, it achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed, i.e. faster than classical particle solvers and more accurate than the deep-learning baselines.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:  \n1\uff09This paper focuses on an important and interesting problem that models the non-equilibrium, N-body nonlinear\uff0c which has the potential for complex physical systems analysis.\n2) The hybrid representation makes sense and works well in the simulations. \n3) The basic idea and technical details are clear.  More details of the network architecture are attached in the supplementary details.\n\nWeakness:\nThe main weaknesses of this paper lie in experimental comparison and technical contribution:\n1\uff09There seem to be some existing methods in the field of nonlinear physical systems modeling, such as LED[1] and  Solver-in-the-loop[2]\nIt is suggested to compare the proposed method with these existing methods. \n2)  There are some methods to fuse the representation of different views, such as Cross-Attention and CCA. Do these information-fusing methods work well in physical systems modeling?\n3) The whole method contains three components.  Which one is most important? It is suggested to add a detailed ablation study.\n4) Using a neural network to learn particle-continuum coupling is not difficult. Did existing methods use the neural network for coupling? If yes, which is the advantage of this method? If not, it is better to analyze the effect of different deep-learning-based coupling methods.\n\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Overall, this paper is well written. The idea and model details are clear enough.  \nBeyond the uniform representation, using hybrid representation achieves good performance on nonlinear physical systems.\nIt is not surprising and it is better to provide more analysis of different information coupling methods.\n\n\nFor reproducibility, the details of the neural networks are attached in the supplementary material. But it is better to provide the source code so that more details can be checked. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Balancing the strength and weaknesses, I think this paper would be better when more comparisons and analyses are conducted. \nBesides, the technical contribution of adding a neural network to learn particle-continuum coupling is limited. ",
