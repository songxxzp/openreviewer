The authors propose a novel method, E-CRF, via combining CNN network with CRF as an organic whole to alleviate BCWC from two aspects (i.e., scale and direction). In addition, the authors make an exhaustive theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of E-CRF. Eventually, the proposed method achieves new results on ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal Context datasets.",

The experiments shows the proposed methods are effective and verified.\n\n\nWeakness\n1. The proposed E-CRF is very similar to Joint-CRF. Though the authors claims that joint-crf  lacks the ability to optimize class representations effectively due to the defective design and E-CRF can solve it well, the experimental results can not show E-CRF improve a lot.  In table 1, E-crf has only no more than 1% improvement than joint-crf. This improvement is not so obvious.\n2. E-CRF adopts superpixel  as an auxiliary to further strengthen the reliability of the message passing to the boundary pixels. Compared with joint-crf, it need more computation for superpixel generation. That is to say, E-CRF use more computation resourses.\n3. There is no model size comparison and time cost comparison.\n",

Since class-weight problem is general for all semantic segmentation models, it could be better to extend the method to other models.  I also look forward to a discussion part for how to extend this method to Transformer-based segmentation models.\n- Although the discussion of BCWC is meaningful, the proposed solution is not novel. The method of discriminating boundary pixels from local representative pixels (e.g., super-pixel center) by measuring their similarities (attention) is commonly used. Similar ideas are in the below papers\n  - OCNet: Object Context for Semantic Segmentation, \n  - SegFix: Model-Agnostic Boundary Refinement for Segmentation\n- The improvement from Joint-CRF is marginal, about 0.5% mIoU.\n- The design of using super-pixel to extract pixel representation is not elegant. It takes additional cost, and the segmentation performance highly depends on the quality of super-pixel. Is there any way to embed this process into the model, to make the partitioned representation learnable?\n\n",

The two semantic classes that share more adjacent pixels tend to have more similar class weights in the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation solution such as DeepLabv3+. The proposed approach tries to ensure that the pixel-wise labeling are less depends on the adjacency.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the gradient-based method to the CNN-CRF-based semantic segmentation. The proposed approach works both the levels of directional and scale, while the previous works only focus on using the gradient-based method from scale perspective. The claimed benefits of doing this is to bring better model that helps brining the boundary-caused class weights confusion down.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros\nThe main contribution of the proposed E-CRF is to introducing the perspective of gradient descent and optimizes the class weights using both scale and direction using back propagation. This seems to be novel to me as I did not find any other similar semantic segmentation works touch this perspective. Recent works either focus on updating the backbone architectures, or on how to do better than the CRF message passing. This paper brings the new perspective of different gradient-based method.\n \nThe proposed approach has backed the claims with impressive results on various challenging semantic segmentation datasets including ADE20K, Pascal Context, and Cityscapes. The improvements are relative small, but the gain is built on top of the previous state-of-the-art methods.\n\nCons\nI think the main weakness is that the paper does not really refer the good literature, making it appears that the gradient-based method is introduced the first time and the authors apply that to the semantic segmentation. In particularly, I would consider the proposed approach is very similar to the other works such as PCGrad (Gradient Surgery for Multi-Task Learning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06782, NeurIPS 2020), while the paper does not cite that one.\n\nAnother issue is that the proposed approach does not provide sufficient experiments to support the claim. I would like to see the fine-grained experiments to show that the proposed approach get real improvements on the classes that are sharing the most adjacent pixels. This will be like a slice-and-dice results from the aggregated results reported by the current experiments.\n\nThird, I am not fully understand how the proposed approach generalize the formulation to the multi-class classification cases. The current formulation presented in the paper only covers the binary case.",

The ablation study is good, fully studying the effects of various components like E-CRF and superpixel. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. It is strange to use superpixel in this paper, which has limited relation to the BCWC problem (the motivation). The superpixel is more like an auxiliary module to boost the performance, since E-CRF alone is not enough for SOTA performance.   \n2. In the ablation study 4.2.1, there is no obvious advantages of E-CRF over joint-CRF, and the F-score gain is less than 0.3%, and mIoU gain is around 0.5%. Moreover, without superpixel. E-CRF is even worse than joint-CRF with ResNet101 backbone (45.47% vs 45.61%). \n\n3. In the Table 4, the comparison of different boundary refinement methods might be unfair. The backbone and test augmentation (e.g. multi-scale testing) of various methods are not specified. For example, in the ABL paper, they can achieve 52.40 with Swin-B and multi-scale testing. The Table 6 has the same problem.    \n4. The section 3.3 can only prove that E-CRF can adjust both the scale and direction of optimization but cannot prove that E-CRF can relief BCWC.
