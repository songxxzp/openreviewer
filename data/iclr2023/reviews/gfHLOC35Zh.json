The deduction is based on the assumption that models are anticipated to be more robust due to the possible redundancy between modalities. The authors also do some controlled experiments and try to support their theoretical analysis.\n",

The complementary is estimated through a litter modification on MINE with a novel information metric.\n2. The organization of the paper is good in general.\n\nCons:\n\n1. My main concern with this paper is its usability. To analyze the complementariness, the methods need the label information beforehand. However, as we have known the label information, one could directly train the multi-modal network and percept the robustness intuitively. I think the use of label information is an obvious drawback of this work.\n2. Some works focus on the reliability of the modality [1], which could also learn the uncertainty (importance) of each modality, which is also a kind of robustness. In contrast, the proposed method could only analyze the robustness of the datasets, ignoring an important perspective, i.e., improving the representation of the network.\n3. Many recent multi-view works about information theory are missing [2-5]. All these methods attempt to establish the relationship between the different modalities and the label information in an unsupervised manner, although these methods are based on some extra assumptions, e.g., mutual redundancy [3,5] or containing view-specific information [2]. Especially, [3,4] also discuss the usability of the missing modality from information theory. The paper could do a better job by citing these relevant works and clarifying the differences between this work and them.\n\n[1] Trusted Multi-View Classification, ICLR'21\n\n[2] Self-supervised Learning from a Multi-view Perspective, ICLR'21\n\n[3] Dual Contrastive Prediction for Incomplete Multi-View Representation Learning, TPAMI'22\n\n[4] COMPLETER: Incomplete Multi-view Clustering via Contrastive Prediction, CVPR'21\n\n[5] Learning Robust Representations via Multi-View Information Bottleneck, ICLR'20",

That is a strong assumption and thus the application scenarios are limited. What if the model takes in noisy or incomplete multi-modal data when training?\n2. The experiment setting seems weak and less supportive. Through Figure 3 and Table 1, it is disturbing whether the deterioration is caused by complementariness or other nature of the dataset itself.  \n3. Details of these datasets had better be provided.\n4. Some special meanings are best represented in the figure. For example, the meaning of $\\Tau_Z$ when modality missing is quite confusing. Should it vary when data suffer from contamination?\n5. This paper focused on two modalities. Then, how to define the metric in datasets with more than two modalities? \n6.

The conclusion is well verified and may help improve model robustness.\n2.\tThe paper is written clearly and is easy to follow.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1.\tHowever, my major concern is that the contribution is insufficient. In general, the authors studied the connection between the complementary and the model robustness but without further studies on how to leverage such characteristics to improve model robustness. Even though this paper could be the first work to study this connection, the conclusion could be easily and intuitively obtained, i.e., when multimodal complementary is higher, the robustness is more delicate when one of the modalities is corrupted. Except for the analysis of the connection between complementary and robustness, it is expected to see more insightful findings or possible solutions.\n2.\tThe proposed metric is calculated on the features extracted by some pre-trained models. So the pre-trained models are necessary for metric computing which is contradictory to that the metric is used to measure the multimodal data complementary. In addition, in my opinion, the metric is unreliable since the model participates in the metric calculation and will inevitably affect the calculation results.\n3.\tThere are many factors that will affect the model's robustness. The multimodal data complementary is one of them. However, multimodal data complementary is not solely determined by the data itself. For example, classification on MS-COCO data is obviously less complementary than VQA on MS-COCO data. As mentioned by the author, the VQA task requires both modalities for question answering, accordingly the complementary is determined by the multimodal and the target task. However, I didn't see much further discussion about these possible factors.\n",

Intuitively, multimodal models are supposed to be more robust than unimodal model as extra redundancy is provided by multimodal data. However, some existing works find that multimodal integration may be more vulnerable to attack, noise or corruption. To understand this contradiction, the authors make a theoretical analysis using information theory. By formally giving the definition of complementary information, the authors establish the theoretical guarantee to quantify the different Bayes error rate of multimodal and miss-/noisy modality cases, and provide a metric to quantify the complementariness of multi-modalities. Experiments on synthetic and real world dataset show the value of measuring complementariness. \n\n--- post-rebuttal ---\\\nThanks for the authors' response. I have read the response and other reviewers' comments. Both reviewer TcW7 and I have a similar concern about the influence of pre-trained model. The authors propose two possible ways of constraining the feature extraction part to be the same. While it is still unclear to me for the case when two to-be-compared multi-modal approaches have different feature extraction modules. Despite this, I still believe there is value of being a pioneering work exploring modality complementariness, but slightly lower my score by accounting the review confidence weight.",
