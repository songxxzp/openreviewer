            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies the optimal transport (OT) profile. That is, the dependence of the OT cost on the amount of mass being transported from the source measure. The main result gives a characterization of the OT profile as a piecewise-linear function. This characterization gives rise to an approximation algorithm that allows to numerically approximate the entire OT profile. The paper also explores a potential application for outlier detection.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The proof of the main result goes by a standard dual characterization of OT solutions. The authors then demonstrate a procedure that takes an OT solution that transports total mass $\\alpha_1$ from the source measure and produces an OT solution of total mass $\\alpha_2$ with $\\alpha_1 < \\alpha_2$. Moreover, it is shown that for any $\\alpha \\in (\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2)$ the OT profile linearly interpolates between the values at $\\alpha_1$  and $\\alpha_2$. Under a slightly restrictive (but probably necessary) assumption of having all costs rational, the above two properties give a complete description of the OT profile. Relaxing the duality condition affords an approximation algorithm for the OT profile.\n\nStrength:\n- The paper studies a relevant problem.\n- The introduced algorithms are practical.\n\nWeakness:\n- The method is not very novel, even if the results are.\n\nSome comments:\n- I would be happy to see a formal definition of combinatorial complexity instead of a footnote. After all, it is a central concept for the algorithms.\n- The fact that the involved probabilities need to be rational should be emphasized, maybe in the Theorem's statement.\n- In the preliminaries section: \"Consider any transport plan $\\sigma$ transporting mass from $\\nu$ to $\\mu$.\" I think the paper adopts the convention that mass is transported from $\\mu$ to $\\nu$.\n- Section 3, first step: I don't think $\\ell_t$ was properly defined.",

In this paper, the authors look at the problem of computing an optimal OT profile for any particular fixing of $\\alpha$ when the underlying distributions are discrete.\n\nThe authors first show that the OT profile is a piecewise linear function with a non-decreasing convex function. They first give an exact algorithm of time complexity $n^2K$ where $n$ is the support size of the distributions and $K$ is the number of pieces of the OT profile. Then for any $\\delta>0$ they give a $1/\\delta$-factor approximate algorithm for the OT profile using $n^2/\\delta+n/\\delta^2$ time. For designing this approximation algorithm, they use an existing algorithm by Lahn et al.\n\nThen they apply the OT-profile computation to the detection of outliers under a certain reasonable assumption of the outliers. They conduct experiments on the MNIST dataset with outliers and show evidence that their algorithms better the existing algorithm in achieving a better accuracy of detecting outliers.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors consider the problem of optimal partial transport. In this problem some fraction of a mass distribution over a set of supply nodes, needs to be transported and distributed to a subset of the demand nodes. The amount of mass supplied or demanded by each node as well as the per unit transportation cost between a pair of nodes are given. The goal is to find the optimal way to transport a fraction $\\alpha$ of the supply mass to demand nodes. \nThe authors are interested to find the so called \"optimal transport profile\" $\\omega(\\alpha)$ which is the optimal transport as a function of this parameter $\\alpha$. The proposed algorithm is a modification of an algorithm by Lahn at' al (LMR algorithm) also using ideas from the Hungarian algorithm like augmenting paths. The modification is needed so that the optimal transport cost if found as a function of $\\alpha$ rather than for a fixed value of it. The running time of the algorithm is output sensitive and proportional to the number of linear parts of the output $\\omega$, which is shown to be a piecewise-linear function. In particular, the running time is $O(n^2\\cdot K)$, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and $K$ the number of linear parts of $\\omega$. They also provide a $\\delta$-approximation algorithm that outputs an approximate profile $\\bar{\\omega}$ that has O(1/\\delta) linear parts and can be computed in $O(n^2/\\delta + n\\delta^2)$ time. \nThe applications mentioned in the paper for these algorithms are Outlier detection and PU learning. The reason why the optimal transport algorithm could be used for the former, is that the existence of outliers would result in a \"sudden jump\" in the OT-profile $\\omega$ since for some sufficiently large value of $\\alpha$, some mass has to also be transported through the \"outliers\".

This is further used to improve performance in a couple of real-world applications. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The algorithms and techniques seem to be similar and heavily dependent on prior work.\n- Regarding prior work, even though the most relevant work is mentioned, the paper is missing a wider overview of prior work on this topic.\n\nMinor comments:\n- In lines 1 and 2 of the Introduction I think $A$ and $B$ should be swapped. $A$ should be the support of $\\mu$ and $B$ the support of $\\nu$\n- Page 2, 4th paragraph,1st line: \"$\\alpha$-approximate\"-> \"$\\delta$-approximate\"   \n- Last paragraph of section 3, line 1: the proof of Lemma 1.1 is not presented there.
