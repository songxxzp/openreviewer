            "summary_of_the_paper": "While most works in self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition have used MoCo for modeling, this paper makes a case for using the positives-only design of BYOL instead. The paper proposes the HYperbolic Self-Paced model (HYSP) according to the principle that more certain samples should drive the learning process more predominantly. The authors empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance on public datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "- Strength:\n    - The paper is well written and the problem being tackled is clearly described.\n    - The introduction of hyperbolic mapping and curriculum learning brings a different perspective to self-supervised skeleton action recognition.\n    - The paper has a detailed theoretical basis and the detailed visible analysis (Figure 2,4,5) further makes the idea more convincing.\n\n- Weakness:\n    - Parts of the approach do exist in prior works. The authors should further elaborate whether the HYSP is a combination of several methods (BYOL + Ganea et al. 2018 + Guo et al. 2022). However, I think that the paper presents a good study on some of the practices and makes a compelling case for using BYOL for the task.\n    - HYSP is not the first method to use the positive-only BYOL and the performance of HYSP is not that competitive. *''Moliner et al. Bootstrapped Representation Learning for Skeleton-Based Action Recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, 2022, pp. 4154-4164.''*\n    - Although mentioned in the conclusion, I still think that HYSP is more like a general improvement of the self-supervised framework for BYOL combined with hyperbolic space. Measurements on image classification tasks may be more convincing and necessary. I have not seen a unique improvement and analysis for the field of skeleton action recognition.\n\n- Other questions:\n    - Double check the last name and first name of the author of the cited paper, some are confused, such as \"Tianyu et al.\" should be \"Guo et al.\".\n    - Please explain Eq.5 in more detail. The conclusion behind Eq.5 cannot be intuitively understood from Eq.5.\n    - In Table 1, SkeletonCLR also uses negative samples.\n    - Does \"w/o hyper.\" in Table 3 mean using BYOL directly? If yes, I think the accuracy is unsatisfactory (see weekness2). If not, please explain in more detail and give the result of using BYOL directly.\n",

",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The paper is well written and easy to follow. The intuitions are clear for the most part. \n- I like the idea of self-pacing for self-supervised learning. The paper proposes a novel approach based on hyperbolic geometry to tackle this. \n- The paper combines ideas from four different areas. The combination is a novel contribution to the field. \n- The approach leads to good gains on some of the tasks considered.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n- While the approach shows good improvements on semi-supervised learning, these do not hold for the other settings. The comparison for finetuning would have been easier if there were numbers reported for ISC. \n- It is not clear from the paper why hyperbolic specifically. The Section 3.2, directly starts with explaining how a hyperbolic extension to SkeletonCLR would work. As far as I understand, the hyperbolic geometry is useful to encode hierarchies, tree-like structures. It is not clear to me why the problem being tackled by this paper needs that. \n- Useful intuition to clarify : What does it mean for a target to be uncertain. I found an exaplanation to this in caption for Figure 3. I suggest you include this earlier in the text to ease understanding. \n- A non-hyperbolic self-paced learning baseline : From Fig 3 caption \".. Uncertainty indicates the difficulty in classifying specific actions if they are characterized by less or more peculiar..\". Is it possible to weigh the usual contrastive learning loss using the distance between positives as a baseline to determine uncertainty? \n- Given that your approach is based on a different framework compared to state-of-the-art, you should include results of a non-hyperbolic baseline with BYOL. This will help determine how much of the improvement can be obtained using BYOL based baseline vs MoCo,  For example, for Image SSL tasks, BYOL is generally better than MoCo-v2. \n- Drop in performance with negatives : While the argument for why negatives cannot be generated in the h space seems convincing, what happens if you generate negatives/apply contrastive learning loss for this experiment on the z space (after projection g) ? \n- Suggestion : I think in addition to linear evaluation, you should evaluate your approach on transfer learning as well. For skeleton-based SSL, NTU -> PKU I/II is a good option. \n- The paper includes details on training time. It would be helpful to include details on how much extra compute/traning time is needed due to the use of Riemannian gradient descent. \n",

The learning is \"self-paced\" in the sense that the magnitude of the gradients for the learning optimization directly depends on the certainty of the learned features. The authors follow a curriculum scheduling approach to stabilize their self-paced model. They also propose a positive-only learning paradigm, showing that adding negative samples into the hyperbolic embedding space deteriorates performance. Overall, the authors show appreciable improvements in action recognition performance using their hyperbolic self-paced model and also demonstrate the benefits of the individual components of their method through ablation studies.",

I was not familiar with prior work around hyperbolic embedding spaces and self-paced learning, but I found the concepts intuitive and the descriptions sound.\n\n2.

The authors back up all their claims around curriculum scheduling, positive-only sampling, and uncertainty in self-paced learning with appropriate experiments.\n\n3. I also found the limitations sections helpful to clearly understand the scope of the work.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n1. While I did not find any major concerns with the work, I am curious how the choice and the quality of positive samples affect performance. For example, how much does the performance depend on \"hard positives\"? Fig. 3a shows the correlation between the feature distances and the uncertainties. If only samples corresponding to the last few columns were to be used in the training (which I'm assuming are the hardest samples), how much would the performance drop? Since humans can perform similar actions with many diverse movements, real-world data can contain many such hard positives.\n\n2. In addition to showing the inter-class variability (Sec. 4.4 and appendix), it can be illuminating to also see the confusion matrix, showing how the variability might be correlated with the per-class performance.",
