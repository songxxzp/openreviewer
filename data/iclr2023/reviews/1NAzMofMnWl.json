            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a benchmark that can simulate and evaluate a variety of manipulation tasks on deformable objects, including fluid, cloth, rope, and elastoplastic objects. The simulator is implemented using Jax, therefore it can also provide analytic gradients, making it compatible with recent popular control algorithms designed for differentiable simulation. \n\nA series of comparisons between differentiable-simulation-physics methods and gradient-free ones are further conducted. The experiments cover a wide range of categories of algorithms, e.g. reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and planning. Based on these comprehensive evaluations, the authors conclude the limitation and advantages of the differentiable-physics-based methods.\n\nIn the end, the authors successfully conduct a real-world Push-Rope task using the control policy from the simulation, which can validate the fidelity of the simulator.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n\nIn my view, the experiments are the highlights of this paper. The authors implement the recently proposed differentiable simulation papers in their benchmark DaX, and compare them with gradient-free methods. The experiments include various robotic learning algorithms. This systematic evaluation indicates that the differentiable-physics-based method can indeed have better performance in some cases, but they also suffer from limitations as many gradient-based methods do, i.e. sensitive to the optimization landscape and initialization. And it also reiterates the importance of exploration in those differentiable-physics-based methods. Moreover, the authors perform real-world experiments, making the benchmark more convincing.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nSince the research of differentiable physics is progressing fast, the authors might better illustrate and clarify its difference from related literature. For example, PlasticineLab is another platform for differentiable soft body manipulation. Since both DaX (fluid, elastoplastic, and mixture) and PlasticineLab are using MPM as the governing dynamics, it is not apparent to me why PlasticineLab cannot support liquid and mixture (in Table 1) while DaX can. Moreover, it is unclear to me how the solid ingredients are represented in Pour-Soup. Are they elastoplastic objects or purely rigid bodies? Is there a coupling issue between the fluid particles and the ingredients?\nFurthermore, the Saving Memory strategy in Section 3.1 is the same as the checkpoint scheme in [1] (Section 4.2), where the back-propagation trades time for memory usage by recomputing the intermediate variables in each step.\n\n[1] Qiao, Yi-Ling, Junbang Liang, Vladlen Koltun, and Ming C. Lin. \"Efficient differentiable simulation of articulated bodies.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8661-8671. PMLR, 2021.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The Quality of this paper is quite good to me as it covers different algorithms, tasks, and physics systems. The analysis after the experiments is insightful and valuable for future research.\n\nThe novelty of this paper is okay as it designs an efficient differentiable framework to simulate soft bodies. It could be better if it can provide more quantitative evaluations of the performance (e.g. comparison with PlasticineLab)\n\nThe experiments and methods look reasonable. And the authors promise to release the entire benchmark and the code, I think this paper should be reproducible.\n\nThe clarity is fine. Here are some sentences that I might need more clarification on,\n\n\u2018The policy complexity grows exponentially with the planning horizon, known as \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d;\u2019 - This is not how I usually understand the \u201ccurse of dimensionality\u201d. Are there more concrete citations or examples of the exponential complexity w.r.t. the horizon?\n\n\u2018Macro-actions reduce the dimension of the action space and the effective horizon, and hence increase the scalability requirement on the DOM methods\u2019 - Why does it increase the requirements instead of making the scaling easier?\n",

Does it mean the overall grid is 32*6*32, or is the grid actually 128*128*128, but only a small region of it is activated? My personal feeling is this setting only applies to a small fraction of the proposed environments, is it?\n- My main reservation is the comparison at the framework level. JAX has a very similar position to taichi and Nvidia warp, which are more famous for physical simulation. And I would expect they have similar performance to JAX-implemented environments, is it? Is DaXBench distinguishable from them because of user-friendliness? Or better interface to deep learning modules? Or speed?",
