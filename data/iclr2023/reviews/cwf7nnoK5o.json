The authors showed that without coverage assumption there would be an ``irreducible bias'' and therefore, proposed a new problem setup called minimax-bias OPI, which targets at estimating (near-)optimal (shortest) interval covering the true value $J(\\pi)$ with a shift at most at the level of the minimax bias. After that, in Sec. 6, they suggested an objective function to compute a near-optimal interval, which is also robust to the misspecification error of function class. Finally, in Sec. 7, they proposed how to computably approximate the solution of the objective function and established asymptotic guarantees.",

The new problem setup minimax-bias OPI is well-motivated, and it's nice to see their methods does not require the common assumptions in previous literatures to ensure the validity.\n\n\n### Weakness\n\nThe final results in Sec. 7 is just an asymptotic guarantee and it is unclear about the convergence speed.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies offline policy interval evaluation for discounted MDPs where the goal is to generate an interval that contains the ground truth with high probability. Specifically, this paper shows that, without the coverage and realizability, there exists a lower bound of the asymptotic bias. Then the paper proposes an interval estimation method that can output an asymptotically valid interval without the coverage and realizability assumptions. When the realizability assumption holds, the proposed interval is shown to be optimal. ",

The setting where the commonly assumed coverage and realizability fail is very practical and worth investigation.\nThe theoretical results are well-structured. The role of each section looks clear.\n\n---\nWeakness: \n1. This paper fails to discuss a series of works that are very related to this one. OPE is an extensively considered problem studied by a variety of authors. Almost every part of this paper has some very related works. To be specific,\n(i) It is already a well-known result that OPE incurs bias without the coverage assumption (e.g. [1]). [2] has conducted a bias as well as variance analysis for OPE of tabular MDPs years ago. The relation between the lower bound in this paper and hardness results from these papers should be discussed as they seem closely related to me. \n(ii) IS/MIS is a common technique for OPE, studied by, [3-5], to list a few. In particular, [3] gives the sharpest bound for tabular MDP under the coverage assumption. How does the bound compare to this paper?\n(iii) Interval estimation is great. However, for some papers with point estimation, the results can be transformed into high-probability intervals (see for e.g. [7, 8] which considered the linear function case). [10] also consider OPE like this paper. Although this paper focus on the setting without coverage assumption, it is still necessary to investigate that, If under the assumption of coverage and realizability, how do these results compare to the interval in this paper?\n\n2. There is no numerical simulation to justify the theory. It seems necessary to show exactly how this paper compares to other IS-based OPE methods for tabular setting with coverage assumption (e.g. [3]). \nMathematics is heavy, but there is not enough explanation of the implication behind the theory. For example, why do we need two variants of Bellman equation; in the tabular setting, if the final bound does not depend on the cardinality of the state-action space, then which term characterizes the complexity.\n\n\n---\n\n[1] Wang, Ruosong, et al. \"Instabilities of offline rl with pre-trained neural representation.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

It would be great to have a more in-depth exposition of the minimax bias. First, it would be better to have a rigorous definition in the \u201cdefinition\u201d environment. Second, explain why it appears. Third, give a concrete example (maybe on a toy problem like bandit) to explain it. \n\n2. The authors seem to assume that $w^\\sharp$ lies in a certain class such that the last term in (8) vanishes. The authors should state this matter clearly. \n\n3. Although the results seem interesting, I am afraid that the bound might not be useful. In particular, the TV-norm of $R_{\\pi}$ seems a very conservative upper bound because $1/ (1- \\gamma)$ is a huge number. That means, if $ R_{\\pi}$ is not small, the confidence region can be vacuous. \n\n4. The theoretical analysis seems not so well developed. First, the TV-norm is not the exact thing used in estimation \u2013 an approximation via convolution norm is employed. We only know such an approximation is accurate when $u$ is sufficiently large. But how large should we need? What is the error when $u$ and $n$ are both finite? Second, the error analysis is merely asymptotic.
