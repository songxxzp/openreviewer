            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper addresses the issue with representing (esp. heterophilic, power law) graphs by factorising the adjacency matrix into a combination of homophilic and heterophilic factors that are interpretable. Lower bounds based on logisitic principal components analysis (LPCA) is improved removing assumptions on the max degree and replacing with the arboricity of the graph. A new graph model is proposed with symmetric and non-negative factorisations based on the decomposition mentioned and a simple gradient descent alogirthm is proposed to optimise the paramters. The method is compared to a baseline SVD decomposition and recent work using a similar method, BigClam. Results on synthetic and real-world data are reported with promising results.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "\nThis paper addresses the issue of modelling graphs with both homophily and heterophily in a elegent decomposition that is both simple and effective. The new lower bound is novel and seems valid to the best of my knowledge but I could not follow all steps in detail due to time constraints and lack of deep knowledge in the area. The algorithm to optimise the model is simple and results looked promising. This is very relevant work, and a hot topic in graph related domains including GNNs for example.\n\nI do wonder about the comparison with the other methods, as in the comparison with synthetic data, the BigClam method was limited to 12 factors, when I think using 20 factors would be interesting, and may lead to improved fitting of the BiClam method. Although the model is elegant, the selection of the hyper-parameters (how many homophilic and how many heterophilic factors) is left open but does not seem trivial is it is vital to the good fitting of the model. With the synthetic data, the exact number of homophilic factors was known (10 towns) and number of heterophilic were known (2 genders), leading to an over simplified problem, as this knoweldge is unknown for a real problem. Exporing this would strengthen the work, like showing the behaviour of the model if choosing 9 homophilic and 3 heterpholic features for example, or how to find those from the data maybe? Some more details about how many features and other parameter tuning of the comparison models in the results would also be important to understand if these seem optimal. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "CL.\n\nTHe paper is very clearly written and presented. A few small questions I did have though to help clear up some details.\n\nFig. 1 - can you add some details on the sampling? Not critical though.\n\nCould you elaborate on why kB + kC = 6k is required?\n\nIf I understand correctly, homophilic clusters, in B, are found as those with positive eigenvalues and heterophilic clusters, in C, those with negative eignevalues?\n\nHow to choose the kB and kC parameter values? Can these eigenvalues above somehow help with this, although for large data this probably not computationally feasible, can you comment?\n\nQU.\n\n\"Many graph models fall under the framework of edge-independent graph generative models\" - some references, including a review paper would be valueable here to support this claim.\n\nIn Figure 3 the learnt features are shown, and the proposed method has captured the ten cities and the additional 2 gender features. Big Clam only learns the ten cities; have you tried with 20 features and BigClam, as this has the potential to learn each combination of GENDER X CITY as an independent feature element?\n\nNO.\n\nThere is a recent paper on overlapping community detection with embeddings that would fit into the cited work here, however, they do not address heterophily as far as I understand, nor do they show proof of exact representation but still it is close to this work:\n\nLi, Y., Sha, C., Huang, X., & Zhang, Y. (2018). Community Detection in Attributed Graphs: An Embedding Approach. Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 32(1). https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v32i1.11274\n\nThe contirbution of introdcuing the heterophilic factors (C) is a very nice contribution, and when this certainly gives the model the capability to fit a graph, with homophilic and heterophilic relations between nodes, with an interpretable representation. A weakness here though is the difficulty to choose the number of positive and negative factors for algorithm, an interesting topic. Additionally, if the other methods, like BigClam have more features, like 20 in the synthetic example, are they able to learn as well given the extra capacity? If so then this method is surely faster, and more interpretable but maybe the ability to reduce the frobenious norm error will be smaller?\n\nRE.\n\nCode is included in the supplementary material. Without the package versions, it may be very hard to get this running in the future. Adding file versions as text in the README or a requirements.txt can solve this problem, including the Python version.\n\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "A very good model, with a new lower bound and a simple optimisation approach. The achilles heel seems to be selecting the number of homophilic factors and number of heterophilic factors. This is not explored in the experiments nor discussed in the paper. Clearing this up would make a strong paper.\n\n[Post Review Updates]\n\nMy questions were clearly answered and I feel that this is a novel and sginificant contribution to a growing are of interest: working with heterophily in graphs.\n\nI have raised my review to an accept as I see this work as ready for publication.\n\n[Post Reviewer-Discussion]\nDuring the reviewer discussion the similarity to the work on Generalized RDPG was brought up and this area of work is not compared in enough detail considering the similarity with the work on homopholic and heterophilic relations in [1]. There was also some questions about the bound, to be clarified. Therefore I have slightly lowered my review recommendation as I felt these were genuine concerns.\n\nI want to emphasize that in my opinion this is an area of growing interest, namely modelling heterophilic and homophilic relations. I feel this paper is well written and shows promising results. I believe this will be a very strong paper with the additions of addressing more closely the GRDPG and related literature, clarifying questions on the bound and ensuring that the real-data experiments are strongly supporting the claims (datasets are those which have heterophilic and homophilic relations, and the comparable methods are state-of-the-art).\n\n1.

The example is very clean though and logical and I sadly fail to think of a good alternative. Is there maybe an example in the medical or chemistry area where there is a simlar repulsion between connected elements. How about an example with fraudseters and customers like in this review [Zheng et al. 2022]? Could it even be enough to just say that in a same-gender dating site the example would actually be homophilic between genders so we use a hetersexual example? A small issue, but just in case it could offend.\n\nZheng, Xin, et al. \"Graph neural networks for graphs with heterophily: A survey.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.07082 (2022).\n",

I'm sure this is not intentional, but the amount of work of these groups is quite large, and published in journals and conferences very related to this one (meaning that this is not a case of similar work but in a very different community) like NeurIPS or PAMI.\nNamely, the RDPG model is widely studied and not mentioned in the paper. The model is almost exactly like the ones described in this work, and moreover, there is a version called Generalized RDPG which takes into account heterophily and homophily, and its formulation is very related to the one proposed in this paper (in equation 3).\n\nI think the Generalized RDPG model is described in this paper:\nP.
