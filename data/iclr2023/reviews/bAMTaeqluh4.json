The authors should compare their method with previous methods that can enhance the robustness to the attacks.\n\nI am afraid that the practicability of the proposed model is quite limited because the labels for the semantic segmentation are required. I understand a smaller number of labels will still be valid as shown in the experimental validation, the requirement to have semantic segmentation labels would severely limit the applications of the proposed model.\n\nThe robustness to the adversarial attacks that attack semantic segmentation models is not discussed.

They proposed a part-based classification model and compared it with a vanilla ConvNet-based classifier (ResNet-50). On three common benchmarks (Part-ImageNet, Cityscapes, and PASCAL-Part), their experiments show the proposed part-based method consistently outperforms the holistic counterpart. They also conducted experiments around attacking the segmentation model and utilizing part-(Segmentation, BB, Centroids) information to further prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The studied direction is important, and this paper takes a step further on deep learning robustness with the help of fine-grained annotations. Overall the use of previous techniques and the design principles (part-based, disentangling irrelevant features, and location-aware) are reasonable. Their approach is properly motivated, and the paper is easy to follow. \n\nExperiments are conducted on three datasets, Part-ImageNet, Cityscapes, and PASCAL-Part, and shown the proposed part-based model achieved consistent improvements under both vanilla training and adversarial training, while the improvements further with adversarial training are limited. The experiments of attacking the segmenter model strongly prove the robustness of the proposed method. Table 6 shows the proposed method can also utilize BB and Centroids to improve model robustness. \n\nOne of the major limitations of the proposed method is the use of extra data annotations (part mask/BB). Also, the part of objects in 2D images is not well defined. It is unknown if Vision Community has a generable \"object part segmentor\" for general 2d images. It is ok to study this in the existing dataset for academic purposes, while the reviewer is unsure if the proposed method can scale up to real-world questions. \n\nAccording to 3.5.2, the author has similar #params and training epochs for the baseline and the part-based model. It is good for fair comparisons, but, the reviewer wonders if the part-based model can achieve higher performance with more training epochs? By using more fine-grained information, it is expected to train longer somehow.\n\nFor the current manuscript, the proposed method is only examined in ResNet-50. The reviewer is curious if the proposed method can work on other ConvNets and ViTs? The use of part masks is natural to introduce Vision-Transformers, which is one of the popular backbones for vision tasks nowadays. It would be good to see the proposed method can model-agnostically improve the robustness.",

Regarding the novelty, the reviewer feels the proposed method/direction is probably not very novel, people may have already exploited similar ideas in 3D data, where the parts of 3D objects are more salient than the \"parts\" of objects in 2D images. Reproducibility is guaranteed as the codes provided in the appendix. ",

Considering the results reported in Table 5, training without segmentation supervision even leads to better adversarial robustness. So that means the extra supervision is more helpful towards clean accuracy but not on adversarial accuracy?\n* The proposed method need extra annotation of segmentation masks, which may not readily available and existing datasets with segmentation masks may not fit the classification task without non-trivial modification. This limits the scopes the proposed approach can be applied on.\n* It's a bit surprising that in appendix D.3, directly attacking the segmentation module does not work well. Can the authors give a bit more explanation about the reason and the detailed analysis of the segmentation attack results (in addition to the classification accuracy). As in [a], it seems that the segmentation task can be easily attacked.\n\n[a] Adversarial Examples for Semantic Segmentation and Object Detection",
