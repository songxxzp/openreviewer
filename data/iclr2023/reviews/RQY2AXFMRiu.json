In the experiments, in some problems, the method has obvious gains.\n\n\n### Weaknesses\n1. The method brings a couple of subproblems to solve for the primal variables in Lagrangian, e.g., (Y-EQ) and (W-EQ). But I also think it might not be a big problem. (Y-EQ) seems to be strongly convex, so it can be well-solved. (W-EQ) is associated with a strongly-monotone variational inequality, so it can also be solved fast. \n2. Even though the paper claims the algorithm is parameter-free, we may need access to problem parameters when solving the subproblems mentioned above. \n\nQuestions:\n1. In the design of the algorithm, why in the equation (1) we want to introduce a new variable y = x in order to use ADMM? Can this problem be solved directly before we replace x = y?\n2. In Section 4.2, it mentioned that in the monotone case, (some) constraints need to be active. Where does this assumption appear in Theorem 3?\n3. Why not compare the algorithm with Frank-Wolfe type of algorithm in the experiment?",

They use the framework of the interior point method with log-barriers to handle the constraints. They merge this framework with the ADMM algorithm to provide the final design of the algorithm which is a two-loop algorithm. The outer loop decreases the penalty parameter progressively which is similar to traditional IP methods for optimization. The inner loop is for implementing the ADMM algorithm.They provide convergence rate for each outer loop (t) in various settings including monotonicity, strong/\\xi monotonicity, their \"star\" (or generalized) versions.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is considering a challenging problem to solve. VI is an important topic of study and including complex constraints seems to be a completely unexplored area. However, there are some problems with the existing results which I would like to point out:\n\n1. My main concern is in the update step of x. It seems that to solve every single step, one requires to solve a system of nonlinear equations, which is a VI problem itself. This problem is challenging and for many applications, one may need a separate solver to get such soltions. However, in the analysis, it seems to be solved exactly. Current complexity results take this as an oracle. Effectively, the theoretical results don't capture the actucal computational complexity of the problem and hence, they are deceptive in nature. Note that this oracle needs to be called in every inner iteration. This makes the technical implementation to be a three-loop algorithm. \n\n2. Update of y may not be easy for general \\phi. Hence, even though the starting framework is general, the method is restrictive in nature.\n\n3. The paper claims that Lipschitz smoothness (Assumption 1) is not required in general. However, if I am not ignoring anything, the reason is precisely that x updated solve F as VI exactly for each inner look. If subproblem solvers are taken into consideration then solving such VI for arbitrary F may already be difficult.\n\n4. The paper in the main part does not discuss how to large T (number of outer loops) needs to be? The convergence rate results are devoid of T. I believe we must have a small mu to get to a good soltuion. However, the error introduced by mu is not characterized in the discussion. \n \n\n",

However, these methods require metric projections onto the feasible set, or Jacobian computations for the VI ooperation, which can be quite costly. \n\nThe goal of the paper is to develop an interior-point method that bypasses the need for projections, at the cost of requiring \n\n(i) a single matrix inversion at the beginning;\n(ii) that the (W-EQ) problem in the text be efficiently solvable (this is the case eg. for linear VI's as those occurring in classical zero-sum games);\n(iii) also, properties stronger than strict monotonicity, plus that the VI operation $F$ be \"non-rotational.\"\n\nUnder these strong assumptions, averaged and last-iterate convergence rates are proven. The method itself is a variant (in some sense) alternating direction method of multipliers. In particular, it is purely first-order. Additionally, its interior nature means that it requires no projections. \n\nSome experiments suggest that the new method compares favorably with alternatives in the literature.

A clear roadmap toward how the algorithm is built as well as its theoretical analysis is provided. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the clear advantage of the algorithm. It is surprising to see that the proposed algorithm can efficiently approach the optimal point while others cycle around the optimal or zigzag near the constraints.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The outer loop $T$ of Algorithm 1 is not discussed precisely, which might cause some confusion. I guess the role of $T$ is to ensure that $\\mu_t$ (line 9) is sufficiently small to handle the constraints $\\varphi$. The complexity should also take into account $T$ and the subproblems, which will contribute additional terms, and thus the lower bounds are only matched up to logarithmic factors. The algorithm can be difficult to implement, also because of this unavoidable triple-loop structure.\n\n2. I am a little bit confused about how to compare the results in Theorem 2 ($\\xi$-monotone) and 3 (monotone). The rates in Theorem 2 are strictly worse than in Theorem 3 when $\\xi>1$, but $\\xi$-monotonicity should be a stronger assumption.\n\n3. Could the author comment why assumption $(iii)$ is needed in Theorem 3? Why does it require $F(x^*)\\neq 0$, i.e., some constraints are active at $x^*$? I think this is implied by the condition $\\inf F(x^*)^\\top \\cdots>0$ that is used for the average guarantee.\n\n4.
