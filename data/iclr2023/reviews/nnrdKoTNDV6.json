The physics-based models are known to be more robust and generalizable compared to data-driven/learning-based approaches (Monga et al, SPM 2021). In fact, for MRI reconstruction tasks such as fastMRI challenge (Muckley et al, TMI 2021), physics-based models have been consistently preferred over data-driven/learning-based approaches. Thus, including the physics of the problem in the network architecture is not a novel contribution, but a straightforward extension of MRF.\n \n2) The generalization performance is questionable. While physics-based model improves the performance over learning-based models, they do not necessarily address the out-of-distribution challenges\n\n    a) Based on the findings in Table 1, auto-encoder models such as RNN-RNN do not suffer from the out-of-distribution challenge.  This somehow contradicts the motivation of the study which introduces physics-based modeling to improve the generalization performance. More concrete experiments must be done to show a clear advantage when facing different data distributions. \n\n   b) Figure 4 results show that BlochNet improves compared to other methods in presence of different RF-Pulse sequences, however, compared to reference it is still far off. Thus, it does not really solve the OOD challenge.\n\n3) Including the physics of the problem tends to have a counter impact on the inference time. A comparative study comparing the inference time is important as inference time plays an important role in medical imaging applications.\n\n4) Please revise the writing as there are repetitive statements (see the last paragraph of the section 2.2)  \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a \"auto-encoder\" for MR Fingerprinting, which is an imaging method in magnetic resonance that captures multiple tissue properties at once (opposed to the \"standard\" T1 or T2 imaging, which captures a single tissue property, or their weighted variants T1w and T2w which only capture relative weightings of that property). The standard physical model taking these properties to the observed signal are the Bloch Equations, a system of ODEs.\n\nThe authors propose to learn an encoder, which (optimally) reconstructs the tissue properties from the timeseries observed measurements, and use the extended phase graph (EPG) method to approximate the forward model (Bloch Eq.s).\n\nThey then present results of various baselines (the standard dictionary method, and several deep architectures) on both a phantom and anatomical data (human brain).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* This method demonstrates an excellent example of physical models being incorporated into deep architectures, and, conversely, deep architectures informing the estimation of real physical properties.  \n* The experimental results are promising, especially in the case of cross-sequence learning.  \n* This, in my opinion, is an excellent use case for deep learning in MRI, since the standard fingerprinting already uses a dictionary method (i.e., is already as a field conditioned on some form of learning), and since the inverse problem here is relatively stiff for some parameters/playbacks.  \n\nWeaknesses (extended comments in Clarity section):\n* The authors do not describe the EPG method of reconstruction or its use. Even considering appendix A.1/A.2, usage is opaque. Since this portion is describing a critical portion of the method, care should taken so that this entire section is as explicit as possible.  \n* The same comment as above, but for the RNN(?) or FC network(?) used as an encoder. This section is completely opaque, except for the fact that some form of learning on the sequence of measurements has occurred. Moreover, section 3.0.2. implies that an RNN is used on the readout timeseries (of fixed length L), while Section 4 refers to BlochNet as (FC-Bloch).  ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The manuscript does not describe the procedure of either the EPG-based decoder, or the encoder. Since this is primarily a Machine Learning venue, explaining how the EPG method can be used to form a differentiable forward model in a reasonable amount of time with reasonable accuracy is, in my opinion, the strongest point of the paper. While the math can be relegated to the appendix somewhat, what it's skipping/making assumptions about and how the outcome in A.2 is exactly what we wanted to find would be very helpful to the reader (is it what we wanted to find? seems to be a k-space representation only in space, so we need this also across time?). A.5 includes computational details, but we need methodological details.\n\nA consistent description of the encoder is necessary. Does this encoder take in more than a single voxel? Is it performed in k-space? (Coil correction?) Is it conditioned on the waveforms? How does it generalize well without knowing about the sequence?\n\nDetails of the phantom would be a nice inclusion also in the appendix, for those wanting to reproduce the lab results.\n\nAdditional comments:\n* Should MSE be used without reweighting T1 and T2? These aren't on the same scale as far as I am aware.  \n* The description of the method as an \"auto-encoder\" is somewhat misleading for deep learning readers; this is a supervised method, while most auto-encoders only have priors/regularization and reconstruction loss. I think this is minor, but it might clarify questions here by renaming the paper somehow.  ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I think this work is significant and novel, and important for the deep-learning/MRI sub-field, but I think it requires a lot more description of the exact construction of the deep learning method to be publication quality and/or reproducible. It is a good idea, and has the pieces of a good manuscript, but missing details in section 3 and inconsistency with section 4 are strong negatives.\n\nGiven a revision fixing these problems (or an explanation of what I have missed/misunderstood), I am willing to change my recommendation.",
