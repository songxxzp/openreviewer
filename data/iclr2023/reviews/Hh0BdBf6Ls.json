            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper is targeted at class-imbalanced node classification. The authors propose UNREAL, an over-sampling-based approach which iteratively adds unlabeled nodes into the training set. UNREAL consists of the Dual Pseudo-tag Alignment Mechanism (DPAM), Node-Reordering, and Discarding Geometrically Imbalanced nodes (DGI). The authors conduct comprehensive experiments over five datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed UNREAL outperforms recent baselines with different GNN backbones.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The paper introduces the target problem in class-imbalanced node classification clearly. The motivation is convincing and strong.\n2. The authors use figures to illustrate the pipeline of the proposed approach UNREAL, which helps readers understand the approach.\n3. The authors elaborate experiment details in the paper including experimental settings and datasets. It enhances reproducibility of the paper.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The proposed approach UNREAL does not solve the class-imbalanced problem in the real world. UNREAL iteratively selects unlabeled nodes from the minority classes during training. In practice, however, the class-imbalanced problem in the test set may be also severe. For instance, suppose we have $20n$ normal accounts and $n$ malicious accounts as the training set for malicious account detection. Meanwhile, the number of malicious accounts in the test set may be also limited (e.g., $2n$). In this case, the new training set formed by UNREAL is still class imbalanced. On the contrary, synthetic over-sampling algorithms (e.g., GraphSMOTE) can overcome this problem and may have better performance.\n2. In Section 3.2, Node-Reordering sorts nodes in the decreasing order of their confidence. The authors should provide a clear definition of the confidence. However, it is not provided either in Section 3 or in the main algorithm.\n3. According to Table 3, using geometric ranking is empirically better than confidence ranking. So why do we need to involve confidence ranking in Node-Reordering instead of solely using geometric ranking? In other words, does the weighted combination of the two rankings really benefit the performance? The authors may answer the concern by explaining in Section 3.2 and conducting experiments in Section 4.\n4. The proposed approach UNREAL involves a few hyperparameters such as $k\u2019$ in $f_{\\text{cluster}}$ and the threshold $\\gamma$ of DGI. The authors should conduct experiments to investigate the sensitivity of UNREAL to hyperparameters.\n5. The main algorithm in Appendix C should be consistent with the description of UNREAL in the main paper. In Section 3.1, the unlabeled nodes are clustered into $k\u2019$ clusters and $k\u2019$ is usually larger than $k$. So $k\u2019$ should be an input of the main algorithm and line 5 in the main algorithm is incorrect. In addition, Section 3.4 implies that UNREAL only adds nodes from the minority classes, which does not appear in the main algorithm.\n6. Please pay attention to grammar. I found many typos in the paper. For instance, in Related Work, \u201ccompensates\u201d should be \u201ccompensate\u201d, and \u201cadjust\u201d should be \u201cadjusts\u201d.\n",

Instead of generating synthetic minority nodes, as well as features and local topology, the authors consider unlabeled nodes, thereby eliminating the challenge of generating synthetic features and neighborhoods.

The experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several baseline methods with different imbalance ratios. ",

For example, I wonder why for each dataset the authors only report the analysis for one imbalance ratio (and different across datasets). The space is actually enough to show all if using more columns.\n* Some concrete examples and qualitative analysis could be valuable to validate the motivations and justify the high improvements over baseline methods. \n",

The author states that \"As far as we know, UNREAL is the first method to use unlabelled nodes rather than synthetic ones in over-sampling approaches to deal with class imbalanced node classification.\" in Section 1.  However, we believe that this is a method of learning pseudo labels for graph node classification tasks. There have been many efforts working on this topic, and thus the contribution of \"using unlabelled nodes rather than synthetic ones.\" may be over-claimed.\n2. As Section 3.3 states, \"Identify the problem of geometric node imbalance (GI) and define a new metric to measure GI.\" Does this dimension has been validated through experimental results or theoretical analysis? I see that the author just referred to a previous article. A meaningful experiment and the theoretical foundation of the \"metric\" created for this problem are also lacking. Overall, this section may not be solid enough.\n\n\n3. It is suggested that the author should improve the paper organization to facilitate paper reading. For example, \"labelled nodes\" and \"aggregation function\" are in Section 2.1. In addition, there are too many notations in the article. It is recommended to organize a notation table.\n4.
