            "summary_of_the_paper": "This manuscript proposes NIML to investigate the node importance in node classification meta-learning tasks. Specifically, it theoretically demonstrates the node importance between neighbors can increase the lower bound of the model accuracy. Then it proposes the node importance meta-learning architecture to learn the importance score of each node and further train a weighted prototype for meta-learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the superiority of NIML.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1. This work provides detailed theoretical proof to demonstrate that assigning higher weights to the samples that have closer distances to the prototype expectation will increase the lower bound of the model accuracy.\n\n2. In general, this manuscript is well written with clear motivations, detailed related works, rigorous proofs, and relatively sufficient experiments, which is easy to follow.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. There are some gaps between the theoretical analysis and the model design. The theoretical conclusion is that higher weights of samples will increase the lower bound of the model performance, which demonstrates that the model design of existing work Proto-GCN and the proposed model NIML are solid. This work proposes the category-irrelevant node attentions and further designs the weighted prototype based on the importance scores. However, the motivations of the proposed category-irrelevant node attentions (different from Proto-GCN) and the weighted prototype are not clearly discussed in this work. \n\n2. It claims that Proto-GCN as the input does not meet the expectations for distance predictor. But it does not provide a detailed explanation. Why is it necessary to design a category-irrelevant node information input? Why Proto-GCN is not suitable for your framework? What\u2019s the main contribution of your model design?\n\n3. The model design is rather simple and not novel enough. The main idea of the model design is to calculate the attention scores between nodes and further learn a weighted prototype. The theoretical analysis is to prove that node importance can improve the lower bound of the model performance. From my perspective, there are some gaps between the model design and the theoretical proof. You should provide the theoretical analysis of your model design and validate that your model design is better than Proto-GCN.\n\n4. The discussion of related works is comprehensive, but some discussion about related works is a little bit vague and does not show the key idea of the related works. For instance, in section 2.3, \u201cMetaHG presents a heterogeneous graph learning model for automatically detecting illicit drug traffickers on Instagram.\u201d The main idea of this work is to design a meta-learning model on heterogeneous graphs to address the problem of the limited labeled drug traffickers on Instagram.\n\n5. The presentations of most equations need to be revised. For instance, there should have a comma between the equation and \u2018where\u2019 (e.g., equations 3, 4,6, and 10). There should have a period after the equation (e.g., equations 1,2,5).",

One of my main concerns is that, the idea of considering node importance in each task is not novel. The authors also mentioned that some work (e.g., Ding et al., 2020) has been proposed based on this point for few-shot classification. I feel this limits the contribution of this paper. Though theoretical analysis for this point is provided, in my opinion, only theoretical analysis is not sufficient enough for a paper. A better organizational form of a paper is to propose a novel/interesting model which is associated with the corresponding theoretical analysis. \n\n2. For the calculation of neighborhood weights, why need to fix the number of neighbors? Is it possible to use all neighbors, since neighborhood sampling may result in information loss?\n\n3. Eq.(15) does not employ $\\mu_c$ as input. So why it can calculate the distance between node $v$ and center $c$?\n\n4. From my view, I feel the experiments are not quite sufficient.

However, unlike traditional ProtoNet where the class prototypes are computed from class samples in an unweighted manner, this paper assigns different importance scores to different samples. The importance scores are derived from a distance prediction function, which is in turn based on an attention mechanism. The paper also analysed the theoretical properties, in which a weighted scheme can improve the lower bound on the accuracy, compared to the unweighted scheme. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

The theoretical analysis is based on the lower bound of the accuracy, which shows that a weighted strategy can increase the lower bound. However, there is still a gap between the lower bound and the true accuracy. Without analysing how tight the bound is, an increase in the lower bound may not necessarily imply the impact on the accuracy. Some discussion on the tightness of the bound can be beneficial. \n\nW2. Ablation study on the importance score: Compared to Proto-GCN, Proto-GCN+GAT can already improve the performance quite a lot, and the marginal benefit brought by the proposed method NIML is relatively small (note the y axis starts from 60. So do we really need the proposed importance calculation? What is the computational overhead compared to just using attention as the importance score?",
