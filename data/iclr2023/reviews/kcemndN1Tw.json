            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new metric, namely IDA-RD, to evaluate image downscaling algorithms quantitatively. To this end, the authors employ the idea that a downscaling algorithm that preserves more details in the resulting low-resolution images should lead to less distorted high-resolution images constructed by state-of-the-art super-resolution methods. Experimental comparisons are made over various downscaling operations with different levels of distortions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n \n1. The paper addresses an interesting problem of measuring the downscaling methods\n2. The paper does contribute some new ideas to tackle the problem at hand\n3. The proposed methods outperform some of the other existing metrics on domain-specific image datasets\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. Missing comparisons: There are some other upscaling super-resolution (SR) functions that are likely to handle the unseen degradations well, for example, methods in [p1-p3]. The experiments should be conducted with these methods as well.\n\n[p1] Designing a Practical Degradation Model for Deep Blind Image Super-Resolution, ICCV 2021\n[p2] Real-esrgan: Training real-world blind super-resolution with pure synthetic data, ICCVW 2021\n[p3] Generalized Real-World Super-Resolution Through Adversarial Robustness, ICCVW 2021\n\n\n2. Conclusions from little pieces of evidence: (Refer: Section 4.3) Based on the results, authors argue that SOTA downscaling methods (Weber et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Oeztireli & Gross, 2015) actually lose more information than Bilinear downscaling. However, this conclusion comes from the assumption that the proposed method is optimal for measuring the distortions of any arbitrary downscaling operation. This assumption is unlikely to be true and needs further evaluation, analysis, and comparison before coming to a conclusion. To this end, I would recommend adding \u201ccomparison: with mean opinion score (i..e, feedback from humans based on perceptual understanding)\u201d, \u201canalysis: such as picking some examples that best reveal the distortion effects and then arguing why the SOTA methods perform poorly in comparison to bilinear\u201d, and  \u201cevaluation: ensure fair evaluation since the SOTA methods might have fine-tuned for say natural images or specific types of images or distortions\u201d. Altogether we need much more experimental evidence in support of this kind of argument that actually contradicts the common beliefs in the literature. Moreover, the experiments are done only with domain-specific images, which also makes adds to the fact that the proposed method is yet an \u201cincomplete metric\u201d.\n\n3. Clarity on the choices of methods: \n- Regarding the GAN generator-based method: Based on Eq. 5, the proposed method employs the downscaling method that we wish to evaluate to generate the LR image for training the super-resolution (SR) method. Such training can be done with any fully-supervised SR method. Henceforth, it is not clear why other SR methods would fail to do the same job or what the limitations are in using other methods. There should also be experiments to support such arguments/failure cases. There seem to be some comparisons under \u201cInvalidity of Non-blind and Non-stochastic SR method\u201d it is not clear if the experiments were done with pre-trained networks or the ones trained with \u201cf_ds\u201d as in Eq. 5.\n- Regarding the SRflow method: This method employs bicubic downscaling for training the SR network is more attractive since we can avoid retraining the SR network to evaluate any new downscaling method. However, as I have mentioned before, a more \u201cgeneralizable to unseen degradations SR network\u201d could be [p1-p3] and should therefore be included in experiments and comparisons. \n\n4. Why only domain-specific datasets in experiments and comparisons?\n\nThe authors seem to have used only the face images for all the comparisons. Why are the natural images not included in the study? Or is it like the authors were trying to tackle metrics for certain domain-specific images alone?",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Weaknesses:\n1. The statement of Eq (2) is very confusing. $Q$ denotes conditional distribution. The distribution of what? Of the lossy image reconstruction function $f$? Is the $Q$ can be written by $Q(f|f_{ds})$? Or should it be $Q(x\u2019|x)$ according to the $P(z)\\to Q(x\u2019|x)$. I don\u2019t know what the random variable is and I don\u2019t know why there is a distribution. From any aspect, Eq (2) seems to make no sense. Moreover, is $x\u2019$ follows a distribution? How can D measure between $x$ and $x\u2019$? Is D a metric of distributions?\n2. The many-to-many part is also very confusing. I know that the generative model generates a distribution or something, but it is not one-to-many. For everything that is generated by the model, we need a latent code. With the latent code, it is not one-to-many. And I don\u2019t think we need a many-to-many statement here.\n3. The above two questions make Eq (4) even more confusing.\n4. In Eq (5), what is $z*$? And the mathematical is not presented in the right way.\n5. For the experiments, There is no conclusive evidence proving that the proposed method is consistent with the human perception results. It is not clear whether the proposed method is linear in evaluation, or whether it is order-preserving. Experiments on synthetic images can provide limited evidence. However, due to the very large degradation of the synthetic images, it is difficult to make such a big difference when evaluating the downsampling method. So these experiments are not enough to provide evidence that their methods are consistent with human perception results.\n6. Are there any other applications of the proposed method? For example as a clue to know new downsampling methods?",
