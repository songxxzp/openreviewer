It uses eigendecomposition to decompose the Laplace operation and uses a variational model, similar to DDPM to learn the generative process. Gaussian noise is added to ensure the diversity of the generated images.\n\nOverall using different blurring ops is an interesting exploration direction.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. Overall the idea is valid and interesting;\n2. This paper provides several interesting analysis such as PSD analysis.\n3. Lots of experiments are conducted to show interesting properties of the model.\n\nWeakness:\n1. There is not much supportive evidence to demonstrate the unique advantage of using heat dissipation. This greatly reduces the novelty of the paper. I believe there should be some important undiscovered advantages to using this approach. As the effective resolution is changing --- can it save the inference time?\n\n2. There are several numerical approach to deal with the Laplace ops: 1. the eigendecomposition used in this paper; 2. directly using Gaussian blurring; 3. grid-based finite difference; To me there seems no significant difference between these three approaches. Although author mentioned numerical stability and some gradient analysis, I would say it is worth really running those models to exam the outcomes.\n\n",

The proposed model is motivated by diffusion models and the empirical success of coarse-to-fine modelling. Specifically, the authors propose to synthesize images by iteratively inverting the heat equation, which is basically a PDE that locally erases fine-scale information. Furthermore, they theoretically interpret the noise-relaxed solution of the forward heat equation as a variational approximation in a diffusion-like latent variable model. Extensive theoretical and experimental analyses have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. ",

Yet, since the paper opens a new way for designing generative models, it is acceptable for me that the quality of synthesis results obtained by the proposed one is not as good as SOTA ones. However, there is no qualitative and quantitative performance comparison between the existing methods and the proposed one. Please explain the reasons.

Compared to the standard diffusion model, inverting the heat equation -- a PDE locally erases fine-scale information -- makes the generation consider multi-scale structures naturally. The paper also shows empirical evidence on emergent properties when applying IHDM, such as disentanglement of color and shape.",

Unlike existing works, the paper directly derives the formulation from the heat equation SDE and analyzes the inductive bias compared to the standard diffusion models.\n\nWeakness:\n-- The empirical results are relatively much worse than standard diffusion models. The paper seems to hide the quantitative comparisons (only small captions in the figure). However, the visual quality is also over-smoothed compared to the baselines. Although it is brought by the change of diffusion process, it is hard to justify \"why we want to apply heat equation in generative models in the first place,\" considering there is less merit in doing so.\n-- Moreover, there are also existing works that try to incorporate Gaussian blurring in the diffusion process. For example, \n\nLee, Sangyun, Hyungjin Chung, Jaehyeon Kim, and Jong Chul Ye. \"Progressive deblurring of diffusion models for coarse-to-fine image synthesis.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.11192 (2022).\n\nSimilar to this submission, their method applies a stochastic blurring process in diffusion models. While having differences, their quantitative and qualitative results are much better and match the same performance of standard diffusion models. I think comparing more carefully than citing them solely and indicating solutions to improve the current method is necessary. \n\n-- Noise scheduling is less clear than the standard diffusion models, especially since this paper involves two hyperparameters, \"sigma\" (forward) and \"delta\" (backward), which, however, are unclear how to choose both of them and how to adapt with the blurring schedule (Gaussian kernel)",
