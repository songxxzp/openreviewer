            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors claim that existing distance metric learning methods update the distance metric based on local relationships and ignore the more global ones (however, this claim is not right). The authors argue that updating distance metric based on the closest class centers has some drawbacks and they claim that the furthest distances must be also used for distance metric learning. To maximize the distances between the class centers they utilize skewed mean function, but it is not clear how this information is used. The authors also show some relations between their proposed methodology and the existing ones and they claim that the existing methods focusing on uniform distributions through energy functions are special cases of their proposed method. Lastly, the authors conduct some experiments on different datasets and report better accuracies compared to the existing methods in the literature.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The only strength of the paper is the reported better accuracies compared to the existing methods. It seems the authors proposed a new method, but the novelty is limited.\nHowever, there are many weaknesses regarding the paper and the proposed methodology. These can be summarized as follows:\ni) First of all, the paper is written very badly. The mistakes start at the first page, the authors forget to include an equation, but they describe the parameters of the missing equation. Also, there are many annotation mistakes as well. The following statements describing the motivations do not make any sense at all: \u201cBecause those samples are on the boundary of the cluster of each sample. Those samples are less to be stuck. Using this finding, we design a regularization term to assign the centers of different classes.\u201d \u201c\u2026 to support our comment that all problems of distance metric learning are about the Lipschitz constant.\u201d\nii) The claim that the most existing methods only consider the local relations between classes and ignore the global ones is incorrect. For example, the UniformFace discussed in the paper targets to learn equi-distributed representations for face recognition. It considers all the relations between class centers. However, the distance metric is updated based on the closest class centers, and it makes perfect sense the closest samples are the hardest ones for separation. The classes far from each other can be already separated easily.\niii) There are methods that update the centers based on the feature representations such as the methods using center loss [1] and discriminative centers [2]. They also consider both local and global relations among the classes and centers are updated dynamically. These methods should be also discussed in the paper. \niv) The authors criticize the methods such UniformFace and methods that target diverse deep neural network weights that are uniformly distributed on a hypersphere. Yet, they do not make any experimental comparison. Especially, comparing the proposed method to UniformFace on large-scale face recognition problems is necessary to support their claims.\nv) There are also mistakes in the tables. There are better accuracies outperforming the authors\u2019 proposed method that must be indicated in bold characters in the tables.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y. Wen, K. Zhang, Z. Li, and Y. Qiao.
