Their main contributions are as follows:\n1. The authors show how an auction can be made credible with just a verification scheme and a penalty. This verification scheme could simply be to bring in a trusted third party for auditing. They also show how to set a penalty that is independent of the auctioneer being untruthful.\n2. The authors also propose a stationary bidder participation model and a method for training revenue-maximizing auctions in this context. They demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a couple of experiments.",

The setup is that the auctioneer proposes an allocation rule and a payment function at the beginning of the game, and then they run a multi-item auction at each time step. The paper proposes using a cryptographic verification scheme and penalties at randomly chosen set of time steps to guarantee credibility. \n\nThe paper then considers the design of revenue-maximizing auctions in the repeated auction setup in the case where not all bidders necessarily participate in the auction at every time step (they change according to a stationary probability distribution). They propose a method for training revenue-maximizing auctions in this model and evaluate the method in simulations on small auction setups. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The idea of using cryptographic verification schemes to guarantee commitment of the auctioneer is interesting. It provides a different approach to ensure credibility than is typically studied in market design (it is obtained by relaxing the assumption of no bidder communication). \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The theoretical contribution is limited. The proof of credibility is straightforward, since the penalty is set so high that it guarantees that the auctioneer would rather stick to the proposed mechanism than deviate. It may be more interesting to investigate tradeoffs between approximate credibility and penalties. \n- The empirical contribution\u2014designing revenue-maximizing auctions in the repeated auction setup\u2014seems incremental relative to existing work in the automated auction design literature (e.g. Duetting et al., 2019, Rahme et al., 2020). \n- The two contributions in this paper\u2014proposing a scheme to guarantee credibility and training revenue-maximizing auctions in the repeated auction setup when bidders can change between rounds\u2014are somewhat disjointed. It is perhaps confusing to combine these investigations into a single paper. \n",
