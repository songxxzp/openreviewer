Fatemi et al [1] showed that transforming the HKG into a KG (conversion approaches) using reification (or S2C) and applying SFs does not work. It is exciting to see that transforming an HKG into a KG and using GNNs+FSs yield better results. I appreciate it if the authors can add detail about this to their paper.\n\nI do not agree with the paper on the importance of semantic information in an HKG. The paper implies that for a hyper-relation educated at, the school is more important than the degree that the corresponding person is educated. This is, however, not given in many datasets and might vary from one dataset to another. Regarding this, can the authors elaborate on how the primary triple in a hyper-relation is identified?

The proposed transformation is equivalent to reification (e.g, as used in RDF, not discussed in paper) + keeping the original fact. The introduced blank nodes share (partial) embeddings with their subject entity, which is a good idea but also the immediate approach after a minute of thought. The GNNs being used are out-of-the-box relational GNNs.\n\nW2. Experimental study not insightful. (i) The experimental study does not describe the experimental setup, most notably hyperparameter optimization. (ii) The proposed methods are sometimes close, sometimes further away in quality compared to related work, but it's not explored why. (iii) In the datasets used in the appendix, the proposed method seems to provide little benefits compared to prior work. (iv) The protocol for evaluating \"link prediction\" in the experimental study is not convincing: It uses a ranking protocol where only one of the entities in a hyperfact is hidden (e.g., degree) but the others are specified (e.g., university). This problem statement does not appear to be model a practical use case. How would one use such a method to predict a new fact and how good would it be? (v) There are no ablation studies to justify the modelling choices (e.g., just make everything binary, or do not keep the original triple after reification).\n\nW3. Arguments about \"semantic difference\" unclear. For a fact such as \"A graduated at B obtaining degree C\", the paper argues that the \"graduated at\" relation is a primary relation, whereas the degree is auxiliary. This argument is not convincing (one may argue the other way around) to me, and, in fact, the is little justification of the need to capture \"semantic difference\". Moreover, even if reification is used (i.e., without keeping the original fact) the HKG is still reconstructable.\n",

Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TransEQ.\n",

Regarding the baselines, The reviewer is confused about the performance of StarE; according to Table 2 in the StarE paper, the best performance of StarE is higher than the reported one in this paper.
