            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an active image indexing approach that allows image copy detection. The proposed solution applies some perturbations to the images during the indexing process which improves similarity search on large databases. Those perturbations are claimed to be invisible to the human eye. Evaluations on the DISC21 dataset showed that active indexing outperforms passive indexing and that the method generalizes to other feature extractors and other indexes.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths of the paper:\n- Active indexing outperforms passive indexing by applying some perturbations on the original image before publication\n- Active indexing seems to generalize well with other feature extractors and other indexes\n\nAreas where the paper could improve:\n- The paper lacks some comparison to state of the art approaches for image copy detection\n- The queries used in the evaluation are not the queries from DISC21 dataset since the authors needed to control the image transformations. This makes the obtained results not comparable to other work using the same dataset. In my opinion a fair comparison to other existing work is needed to validate this approach, specifically that the contributions are incremental. \n\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The paper is well written and easy to understand\n\n- The application of this approach is constrained by being able to apply some transformation on the image and indexing it before releasing it to public. Also, how and who will hold that index and make it available for CID applications? In my opinion, this is a huge constrain specifically if applied to real world applications and constrains its usefulness to only big search or content sharing companies like Google or Facebook, or to be used in a blockchain type of application. I would like to see more explanations on how such a technique could be used to solve real world problems.\n\n- What's the effect of adding new images to the index? \nSpecifically, this approach uses K-Means for space partitioning, which could be sensitive to how much the images used for training are representative of all images the system is able to index and retrieve, whether those are domain specific or not. In other words, an evaluation (or at least a discussion) showing that adding more images to the index (in any iterative way <> a one time indexing) will not impact the space partitioning and the copy retrieval.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I like the proposed approach in this paper and the quality of the writing. The contributions of this paper are incremental and the paper lacks some comparison to some state of the art approaches for image copy detection (needed from my perspective to add credibility to how effective active indexing is). I also have some concerns regarding how useful such an approach is for real world applications, and even for solving research related problems. ",

Large databases rely on indexes for approximate and efficient search, but the challenge comes when copies are significantly modified and then its representation switches indexing partitions and the closest neighbour cannot be returned. The authors address this problem by modifying the image in a way that its representation is pushed towards the center of the indexing partition, giving more \"room\" for edited images to still fall in the same partition as the original copy. This is done by minimizing and indextation loss back to the image pixels, assuming that the image can be modified before its release.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n- The paper is very well written and very well motivated by pointing out the challenges that indexing faces regarding copy detection and proposing a solution for it.\n- I really like the main idea proposed in this paper of imperceptibly modifying the image in order to push its represnation to the center of the indexing partition to make it more indexing friendly.\n- The paper contains a thorough experimental analaysis that justifies the authors claims and shows that their method significantly improves retrieval performance on a number of neural extractors and indexing structures\n\n\nCons:\n- The fact that the image has to be modified before its release is a big limitation since it cannot be applied to already existing databases where images have already been released. However, it can still be applied to new images released in the same database, benefiting all future releases.",
