They start from Miller's framework to link counterfactual reasoning and saliency-based XAI techniques.

The proposed framework is qualitatively evaluated on one synthetic dataset.",

The authors should better explain possible applications of the proposed approach and recap their contribution and future work in a Conclusion section. \nThe proposed framework is tested qualitatively on only one dataset; therefore, it is quite hard to assess its performance and usefulness in real-world applications. The authors should at least provide some quantitative metrics on their synthetic dataset, comparing their framework with other approaches or, if not possible, at least with random or naive approaches.\n\nOther comments:\n- page 3: \"Our framework addresses all the aforementioned concerns we identified with saliency-based approaches in forecasting: (i) the counterfactuals or alternate 'causes' in our framework pertain to real preceding windows of actual observed features, and are therefore consistent with the underlying data generation process and semantics preserving\". To me, this statement is not obvious. Sampling perturbations from past observations does not ensure semantic consistency with future observations. For example, a past observation could only be consistent in certain time series timesteps around specific patterns.\n- pag 5, 3.2: \"salent\" instead of \"salient\".\n\nIn summary, the work is fascinating, but the evaluation part is extremely lacking, and its applicability in real-case scenarios is not adequately discussed.",

The introduction of this paper is a little dense, and several concepts are not formulated mathematically, including \u201cassociative\u201d, \u201cinterventionist\u201d, \u201ccounterfactual\u201d, \u201cspeculation\u201d, \u201csurprisal\u201d, etc. In the field of explainable AI, researchers are expected to define the mentioned concepts in rigorous mathematical language. Maybe the above concepts are meaningful, but none of them are analyzed mathematically. Therefore, the discussion on these concepts will hardly make sense to readers. Please provide formal mathematical definitions for these concepts, and then discuss their relationship to the proposed method.\n\n2. There lacks evidence to support the claim that \u201cthe proposed method is grounded in preattentive human cognition.\u201d First, as mentioned above, please mathematically define components in preattentive human cognition. Second, please provide a theoretical proof to verify that the proposed method indeed aligns with the theory of neuroscience.\n\n3. The actual setting of $\\phi$ in Section 3.2 is inconsistent with the introduced physical meaning of $\\phi$ in Section 2. In Section 2, $\\phi$ is defined as a mapping from image locations to image features. In this case, modeling the distribution of image features as $p_\\Phi$ makes sense. It is also meaningful to measure the amount of information using $-\\log p_\\Phi$. However, in Section 3.2, $\\phi$ is defined as a mapping to the entropy of the output. Then, what is the purpose of modeling \u201cthe distribution of entropy as $p_\\Phi$?\u201d The entropy has its own physical meaning for measuring uncertainty, but modeling the distribution of entropy is meaningless. I suggest authors provide more clarifications on this issue.\n\n4. Authors are encouraged to discuss more about the link between counterfactual reasoning and their method of saliency.\n(1) First, I suggest authors mathematically define the \u201ccounterfactual explanation\u201d for forecasting settings, instead of only giving a description as \u201csimulating alternative causes to see whether the event still happens\u201d (in Table 1 of Section 1.1). In this way, the connection between the proposed method and counterfactual reasoning can be explained in a more rigorous way.\n(2) Second, I do not find experimental results on such counterfactual explanations in Section 4, though authors mention in Section 1.3 that they \u201cexamine changes in the future density predicted by M in response to different realizations of real-world sequences $t_{obs}$.\u201d Please conduct some experiments to verify that the proposed method is able to provide counterfactual explanations. \n\n5. Experiments in this paper are insufficient.\n(1) No baseline method is compared. Authors are suggested to compare the proposed method with existing widely used attribution methods, including Saliency [cite 1], Occlusion [cite 2], Input x Gradient [cite 3], LIME [cite 4], LRP [cite 5], Shapley value [cite 6], DeepSHAP [cite 7], etc.\n(2) Authors also do not verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on benchmark datasets for the time-series forecasting task.\n\n6. About experimental details.\n(1) What is the specific form of the future and observed features, $i.e.$, $X$ and $Y$, corresponding to Algorithm 1?\n(2) Which one of the three approaches introduced in Section 3.3 is chosen for the experiment to compute the differential entropy?\n(3) Moreover, how well is the estimation of the distribution Y|X based on the Gaussian distribution and autoregressive decoders? Please provide a metric to quantify the estimation error, and verify the accuracy of such estimation.\n(4) The saliency map in Figure 3 is problematic. Figure 3 shows that the saliency of frames where the nod is not in motion has a zero saliency value. However, the information of the position of the current speaker also affects possible futures. Thus, the saliency of frames where the nod is not in motion may be low, but not zero.\n(5) Minor: \u201cSaliency\u201d in the last third line of page 8 is supposed to be \u201centropy\u201d. According to Figure 3, when the nod begins, the entropy drops, and the saliency increases.\n\n7. About the limitation of the proposed method.\n(1) For the time-series forecasting task, the proposed attribution method simply computes the square of the gradient\u2019s L2-norm. Is it equivalent or similar to existing gradient-based explanation methods, such as Saliency [cite 2]?\n(2) In Section 2, $\\phi$ is restricted to a differentiable function. However, the mapping from image position to feature vector is usually not differentiable, because the image position is a discrete variable. Please provide some clarification for this issue.\n\n[cite 1] Simonyan, Karen, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. \"Deep inside convolutional networks: Visualising image classification models and saliency maps.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.6034 (2013).\n\n[cite 2] Zeiler, Matthew D., and Rob Fergus. \"Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks.\" European conference on computer vision.

In particular this submission does a very nice job of arguing why one should use the approach presented, and not just how it works. I suppose we should expect nothing less from a paper about causal explanations.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMy primary concern with this paper is in the empirical evaluation. While I understand that the problem statement itself is somewhat new, it is still very important to compare the proposed method against (even potentially very weak) baselines. Otherwise, it is impossible to determine whether the proposed method actually delivers on its promise. Additionally, while the figures presented are helpful for their explanatory power, it is very important to somehow quantify performance in terms of some metric. Unfortunately I don't have any concrete suggestions on such a metric.\n\nWhile it's not necessarily a weakness per se, I am somewhat concerned about the use of the term \"counterfactual\" here when the authors do not hold exogenous noise constant between factual and counterfactual worlds, as described in (Pearl, 2009) Chapter 7. It would be very helpful for the authors to clarify exactly how the abduction-action-prediction process ala Pearl is reflected in this work. Related, it would helpful to discuss some of the common issues in counterfactual reasoning here, e.g. necessary assumptions for identifiability.\n",
