            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a low-light enhancement method to simultaneously enhance low-light images and suppress noise. The proposed method obtains the noise level of a low-light image and initial illumination layer using a network. Based on the initial illumination layer and the noise level, another network is used to estimate the initial reflectance layer where the noise is suppressed. Finally the initial illumination layer is adjusted using another network, and the output is multiplied with the reflectance layer to obtain the enhanced image.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The paper is easy to read, and the proposed pipeline is easy to understand and implement.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The paper is lack of novelty. There are no interesting and innovative ideas in the pipeline. The is no verification on whether the noise maps are accurate, particularly for noise that is beyond the training data. In real images taken from different cameras, different scenes, lighting, etc, noise distributions and levels vary significantly. The images in the training data might not be able to capture all the variations. This issue is not only for noise, but also for illumination and reflectance layers, which in many cases do not have ground-truths.\n\n2. The proposed unfolded total variational network seems to be similar to Zheng et al.'s adaptive unfolding total variation network. \n\n3. Retinex-based low light enhancement has been explored in many papers (RetinexDIP, RetinexNet, LR3M, etc). The novelty of the paper is mainly on the noise maps, which the significance is unclear. Moreover, some recent papers are not discussed or compared with:\n(1) Yang, Wenhan, et al. \"Sparse gradient regularized deep retinex network for robust low-light image enhancement.\" IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 30 (2021): 2072-2086.\n(2) Ren, Xutong, et al. \"LR3M: Robust low-light enhancement via low-rank regularized retinex model.\" IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 29 (2020): 5862-5876.\n(3) Wang, Yufei, et al. \"Low-light image enhancement with normalizing flow.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

No. 3. 2022.\n(4) Sharma and Tan, \"Nighttime Visibility Enhancement by Increasing the Dynamic Range and Suppression of Light Effects\", Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2021.\n\n4. For the qualitative evaluation, it is unclear how much the noise affecting the input images. The paper should boost the low-light images to show the level of noise. Different cameras produce different noise levels. A good evaluation shows that even with the presence of a high level of noise, the method works adequately. \n\n",

Also, for some reason, they did not evaluate on sRGB-SID and ELD datasets, where UTV (Zheng et al., 2021) was tested on.\n\nLLFlow (Wang et al., 2022) is not discussed in the text and also missing in the references.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a Retinex-based low light enhancement approach that explicitly identifies and removes noise as part of the process. The algorithm uses an iterative Retinex-based method for computing both the illumination and a noise map simultaneously. The computed illumination map is designed to minimize noise, leaving the noise signal in the reflectance map (reflectance = image / illumination). The computed noise map and the computed reflectance map are the inputs to a U-net trained to produce a clean reflectance map. The computed illumination map is passed through a neural network to enhance the lighting.  Multiplying the clean reflectance map with the enhanced illumination map updated produces the clean, re-lit output. The method is evaluated against multiple other methods on a standard data set.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The method demonstrates good results both qualitatively in the selected examples and quantitatively on the LOL data set. The explicit computation of the noise map and forcing the noise signal into the reflectance are interesting contributions to this problem. The separation of the illumination and reflectance for noise removal helps to mask heavy-handed processing in the reflectance.\n\nThe paper could use a second pass with an editor. For example, in the last sentence of section 3.2, the phrase \"The illumination is processed to\" should be removed from the sentence.\n\nThe description of the unfolding total variation model, section 3.1, has some undefined elements. For example, the symbol rho sub-r in equation 4 is not defined in the text. Instead, a variable r is referenced, which seems to be referencing rho. \n\nThe authors note that a gamma correction is often used for the illumination modification process, but they chose to use a six layer NN. This modification is not evaluated in the ablation study, but it would be interesting to understand the importance of this substitution to the overall performance, especially given the difference in computational complexity.\n\nHow different is the noise map from a simple map of average intensity?  If the noise is correlated with overall intensity, then the average local intensity might be a sufficient approximation to the noise levels. The paper does not really discuss qualities or properties of the identified noise maps and whether a simpler approach might work as well.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The approach to reducing noise by using the Retinex illumination estimation process is a novel contribution to the problem of low light enhancement. The work seems to be reproducible, with the caveat that the total variation process is not fully described in this paper, but is available in the referenced work.\n\nAs noted in several places, this is derivative work from a prior paper.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The approach makes good use of the illumination/reflectance separation by driving the noise into the reflectance map and then repairing the reflectance map. The end-to-end training of both the noise reduction and the illumination enhancement enable them to be complementary in solving the problem.\n\nThe method presentation could be improved, and there are some additional items it would be nice to see in the ablation study.",
