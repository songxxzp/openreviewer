The framework provides all the tools needed for analyzing the traffic of a large city, including a simulation engine, a data engine, and a scenario builder. There are also capabilities provided that enable a user to introduce custom traffic and driver behaviors.  Although the work is much needed, but there are almost no fundamental improvements within the theoretical domain. ",

The experiments show the success of the framework and its interfaces, but there is not much fundamental scientific contribution. The framework will assist the scientists and will surely spur the research in the traffic analysis domain, but does the paper offer a new paradigm or a new algorithm? I am afraid the answer is no. The only contribution that can be associated with a conceptual level is the change in the architecture of the simulation engine that decreases page faults. \n\nEven that is not significant as a reduction in page faults will only affect when the computer memory is low or the size of the simulation is very large. For all other cases, the change in architecture does not make much of a difference. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new traffic simulator to support large scale scenarios that include thousands of intersections and vehicles. Compared to prior work, the simulator is implemented in a more efficient parallelized fashion to enable such large simulations. The paper also proposes a new dataset of 100 traffic networks processed from OpenStreet map along with benchmarks for various traffic control tasks such as traffic signal control and congestion pricing. Experiments show the simulator is more efficient than prior works and that baseline methods for traffic control tasks can indeed be run in the simulator ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* A very large scale and realistic traffic simulator could be useful for things like learning and evaluating traffic behavior models, especially in the context of reinforcement learning.\n* The proposed CBData with 100 road networks across the world is an interesting dataset that may be useful for several tasks in the community.\n* Experiments show the proposed simulator can handle very large scale simulations (thousands of intersections and vehicles) more efficiently than relevant previous simulators. Also, that the traffic behavior model can to some extent be tailored to a specific map through black-box optimization of parameters using GPS data.\n* Extensive code and clear documentation is provided which would greatly aid reproducibility and use of the simulator.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* It is not clear until the very end of the intro that the traffic \u201cpolicies\u201d considered here are things like traffic signal control and not the driving policy that controls traffic behavior. This really should be made clearer both in the abstract and early in the intro. But I\u2019m wondering why the simulator is only shown for high-level traffic flow tasks? As a microscopic simulator couldn\u2019t it be directly used for learning behavior models as well?\n* The paper does not mention or cite nuPlan (https://www.nuscenes.org/nuplan), l5kit (https://woven-planet.github.io/l5kit), or Carla (https://carla.org/) which are comparable traffic simulators. nuPlan and l5kit also include large scale real-world data for both maps and traffic that can be used in simulation. Though these simulators are not meant for tasks like RL, they do include detailed real-world maps along with real traffic on these maps (unlike the proposed simulator, which simply evenly distributes traffic across the map to start simulation). Moreover, at least some of them support custom traffic behavior models so it's not true that the proposed CBEngine is \"the first traffic simulator to support easy-to-use customization of vehicle behavior models.\"\n* In general, the paper does not do enough to convince that the need for 1000s of intersections and vehicles compared to 100s already supported by prior simulators. Sec 4 shows it\u2019s possible to run baseline methods using the simulator, but I don\u2019t think it actually \u201cjustifies the plausibility of our simulation\u201d since metrics are only reported for the proposed simulator. It would be better to compare metrics on the proposed simulator to those in a prior simulator (like SUMO) that\u2019s already accepted as plausible. It would also be more convincing to show an application like training an RL traffic driving model that truly requires the large-scale parallelism the simulator provides.\n* The organization and presentation of the method is often confusing and unclear. For example, Sec 2.1/2.2 are high level and vague, and no details of the behavior model are given until much later in Sec 3.2.1. Also, experiments are scattered throughout the description of the methods, making them sometimes hard to follow since the full context of the method has yet to be described. \n* For the simulator to be useful it\u2019s important that traffic behavior be realistic, but currently this is not sufficiently supported. Firstly, the actual traffic model used is only very briefly described as \u201csimilar to IDM\u201d and is only evaluated by deviation of average speed to ground truth which is a very coarse metric. A more comprehensive metric that compares the full distribution of speed and accelerations for individual vehicles would be more informative (e.g. see [BITS: Bi-level imitation for traffic simulation, Xu et al., 2022]) in evaluating realism. It\u2019s also not clear does the simulator support more recent learned traffic behavior models (e.g. [TrafficSim, Suo et la., CVPR 2021])? Many of these are implemented in Python \u2013 is this supported by the simulators C++ interface? I would also appreciate some qualitative visualizations of the simulated traffic.\n* It\u2019s not clear what is the granularity of the road networks provided in CBData. Does this have lane-level information or is it just the coarse road network?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "As discussed in the weaknesses before, I think the clarity and quality of the presentation could be substantially improved. I would recommend first describing the simulator together including traffic driving model, data, and benchmarks in detail before going into experiments. There are also many typos throughout that should be fixed. \n\nThough the work provides some novelty in the sense that the simulator is faster and makes a large scale dataset of road networks available, the actual technical innovation is limited. The main improvement in simulation is an implementation detail of how things are parallelized, and no methodological improvement that leverages the simulator is presented.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I can see why a large scale simulator like the one presented could be useful for several aspects of traffic modeling, but the current paper does not do enough to convince this and has several issues in terms of presentation and clarity. Moreover, I don\u2019t think this is a great fit for ICLR considering the limited contribution on the technical/learning side. \n\n\n================= After Author Response ========================\n\nMy initial review focused on the paper's connection to traffic behavior modeling and not necessarily the problem of traffic flow control, which I now understand is the focus here. The authors have clearly detailed the key differences between these two, why low-level behavior is not as important for traffic flow, and what makes simulation for traffic flow control unique. I think it's good they changed terminology to \"traffic control policies\" although I think \"traffic flow control policies\" would be even more clear.\n\nAfter re-considering the work in the context of traffic flow control, I have raised my score to a borderline accept.\n\nWith the newly added information in the paper on the behavior model, I think it makes the context and organization more clear. Moreover, the added experiments showing similarity of CBEngine traffic to SUMO indicating it is reasonable enough for traffic flow applications; and the behavior can be extended with their API.\n\nI am still concerned about the fit with ICLR seeing how the technical novelty is extremely limited; the contribution here is purely one of a simulation framework and dataset. Also, while the paper shows previous traffic flow methods can be successfully applied at new scales in the proposed simulator, there is no demonstrated empirical advantage to doing so (e.g. showing that training at a larger scale improves performance compared to smaller scale). However, previous works in this field have demonstrated the desire for operating at such city scales (Chen et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2022), so I do believe the proposed simulator and dataset would be a benefit to the community. In the end, I think it would be more beneficial to for this framework to be published and made available than not. And the authors have already shown a commitment to this by releasing code and detailed documentation.",
