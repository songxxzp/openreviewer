            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies empirical risk minimization with differential privacy and has two main results:\n\n* A simple reduction from constrained to unconstrained minimization that preserves, convexity, the Lipszhitzness constant (with respect to $\\ell_2$, and optimal solutions. This reduction allows extending privacy lower bounds from constrained to unconstrained optimization. This implies a lower bound for ERM under pure differential privacy in the unconstrained setting. \n\n* A lower bound of $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{d \\log(1/\\delta)}}{\\varepsilon n}\\right)$ for ERM under $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy where the loss is the $\\ell_1$ norm and optimization is over the cube $[-1, 1]^d$.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "I enjoyed the reduction, which is simple but very neat. The idea is to take a convex 1-Lipschitz loss function $\\ell$ defined on a convex domain $K$, and extend it to all of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ by taking its inf-convolution with the $\\ell_2$ norm. This is a convex 1-Lipschitz loss function it is not hard to show that it induces an ERM problem with the same optimal value and solution. \n\nThe second lower bound is less exciting and follows from fingerprinting code techniques that are now standard.\n\nThe main issue with the paper is that the paper extends existing lower bounds in relatively minor ways. I am not sure how significant it is to extend ERM lower bounds from constrained to unconstrained optimization. Moreover, it seems like the lower bounds with respect to functions Lipschitz in $\\ell_p$ were known for $1 \\le p \\le 2$, which is also the regime in which these lower bounds are tight. These are both good things to know, but not groundbreaking.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Regarding novelty, the idea of the reduction from constrained to unconstrained optimization is novel in the context of private ERM, although probably classical in optimization. The techniques for the second results are, as already mentioned, pretty standard.\n\nThe paper is reasonably clear. In some places the arguments can be written better. For example, equation (7) is not justified. This is easily fixed --- the argument used to prove (9) in fact shows that for every $\\theta$, $\\tilde{L}(\\theta, D) \\ge \\tilde{L}(\\Pi_K \\theta, D) = L(\\Pi_K \\theta, D)$, which implies both (9) and (7).",

The ideas of extending the lower bounds to the unconstrained case are novel.\n3. The paper uses the $\\ell_1$ norm to give lower bounds for DP-ERM for a variety of $p$-norms.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. For the jump from constrained to unconstrained case, the assumption of knowing an initial point $\\theta_0$ at a distance at most $C$ away from optimal, essentially makes the problem a constrained minimization problem and the rest of the calculations are fairly elementary.\n2. For the bounds using $\\ell_1$ norm, most of the heavy-lifting is done by previous work.\n3. Adding instances of why these geometries are useful and giving algorithms that achieve these bounds can make this paper stronger.\n4. It is unclear to me (and I am open to changing this opinion in deliberation with other reviewers and the meta reviewer), how much of a contribution this paper is to the ICLR community. I believe this paper would make an excellent contribution to TMLR since the proofs are correct and it would be nice to have something to cite instead of doing these things yourself as a part of another paper.
