            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a way to project a probability measure P0 onto the finite population P1, P2,..,Pn of the other measures. The projection idea is based on the weighted averaging of the optimal transport maps P0->Pn for the quadratic transport cost (the projection implies computing these weights for averaging). The authors prove statistical consistence results for the measures available by empirical samples and show the application to estimate causal effects via synthetic controls.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**\n\n* The proposed projection methodology is straightforward and does not require solving a bi-level optimization problem as, for example, in the barycentric coordinates approach [2].\n* Theoretical consistency results for the weights recovered from empirical samples;\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n* The proposed approach to projection method is rather obvious;\n* The writing of the paper is not very good in many aspects and the paper is hard to parse:\n* * **(a)** the current text overcomplicates the proposed idea too much; \n* * **(b)** the actual contributions are not clearly stated;\n* * **(c)** the experimental part is not transparent;\n\n* Experimental support of the proposed ideas is not sufficient;\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The proposed idea is novel but I would argue that it is obvious and lies on the surface. Indeed, the theory and the entire idea presented here might seem non trivial, but actually it is just the \n* linearization of the Wasserstein-2 space based on the Monge embedding w.r.t. P0 (which maps measures P to transport maps P0->P which are elements of the functional L2(P) space), see definition 1.1 in [1]\n* Projection of the identity function \u201cx\u201d in L2(P) to the convex Hull of Monge embeddings of P1, P2,...,Pn which can be reduced to n-dimensional convex problem.\n\nI do no understand why do the authors overcomplicate the entire exposition so much and why the theory of the tangential spaces is needed in this paper. It does not provide any useful information. In my view, everything what is described in pages 4-6 could and should be compressed to at most 1 page.\n\nThe experimental part is not sufficient to demonstrate that the proposed methodology is practically useful. The main issue here that it is not possible to understand the experimental setup of section 4. What are the distributions P_0, P_1,.., P_n here, how exactly are they obtained? It is not even written what is the dimension of the considered experiment. I bet some details are in Appendix, but this is not satisfactory as all the major details should be explicitly clarified in the main text. I think that it would be several times better if the authors include more experiments and experimental details to the main text instead of too long exposition of the tangential projection (see my comment above).\n\nFinally, as far as I understand, no baselines are considered in the paper. I wonder why the authors do not test their method at least in some setups of [2] and do not compare with [2]. Specifically, it would be interesting to see how the proposed method works in the case of Figure 10 of [2].\n\n**Replicability:** moderate. On the one hand, there are not a lot of clear technical details of the implementation in the paper. On the other hand, the code for all the experiments seems to be present in the provided supplementary.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] M\u00e9rigot, Q., Delalande, A., & Chazal, F. (2020, June).

            "summary_of_the_review": "I do not think that the contribution of this paper is significant. In my opinion, the authors explain rather straightforward things by employing non-trivial facts such as tangential spaces, etc. At the same time, this seems to be absolutely unnecessary as the space they work in is just linear. Thus, I think the paper does not present any non-trivial results or ideas. Moreover, the writing should be improved/simplified. The only potentially positive and interesting result is the consistency theorem, but it is outweighed by the above-mentioned drawbacks of this paper. Thus, I think this paper is currently far below the ICLR paper standard and I vote for rejection.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose to use the 2-Wasserstein space over some Euclidean space to approximate high-dimensional probability measures in a low-dimensional setting. The authors proposed to do this in three steps, (i) the first is to obtain the general tangent cone structure at the target measure, (ii) the second is to construct a regular tangent space if it doesn't exist, and (iii) the third is to perform a linear regression to carry out the projection in the tangent space.\n\nThe challenge is to compute the corresponding optimal transport plan between the target and each measure used in the projection. The authors propose to do this using the classical synthetic control estimator. The introduction of the control estimate creates a hierarchical optimization, where first the distance is minimized between the parameters of the model and the set of control measures. The second layer of optimization then finds the minimum between the minimum of the set of control measures and the target (Eq.(2.3).\n\nThe authors show that the hierarchical structure is well defined between the regular target measure and the second of control measures and the target measure and the set of control measures. The authors also derive the consistency of the optimal weights/\n\n",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "\n(1) I feel that background and contribution should be split so that the contribution of the authors is much more clear. For example, Section 2.1 and the first half of Section 2.2 and Section 2.3 are backgrounds. While Eq.(2.3) and Section 2.4 onwards appear to be the author's contribution which appears to be mixed into the background. (of course, this is just the preference of the writing style, the authors may say this reads a bit better. But I tend to disagree.)\n\n(2) Are the control measures the same size as the target? If so, how scalable is this? It doesn't appear to be scalable to high dimensions at all. This should be at least discussed as from my understanding, the projection into lower dimensional space is to make this much more computationally efficient. But the complexity of the model was not been discussed at all.\n\n(3) Section 4 doesn't appear to be self-contained. After reading Section 4, I have no idea what you have done. I may need to read your references to understand your experiment setup.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. I feel that the paper has some reasonable novelty to it. However, the main drawbacks are that there is no discussion of the computational complexity and a weak experiment section without any clarity of the experiment set up, and no benchmark to compare against to properly evaluate the performance of their proposed approach over other state-of-the-art approaches. Though, I do understand that this is a theoretical paper, but some sort of benchmark with comparably approaches should be made to show where it sits in the literature.",
