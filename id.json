                    "value": "This paper considers the design of neural networks for simplicial complexes, which are more general combinatorial structures than graphs, but less general than hypergraphs. The authors propose to use multihop aggregation schemes to build an architecture that is more expressive than the simplicial Weisfeiler-Lehman isomorphism test, while satisfying useful invariance, equivariance, and expressivity properties. They also demonstrate the efficientcy of their proposed method, and its performance for a few different tasks in simplicial data processing."

The proposed method is demonstrated to be quite efficient in comparison to existing ones, with similar performance as well."

As noted in the list of questions and suggestions, the claimed properties of the proposed models are not clearly true, possibly due to this misunderstanding."
                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "My most important concern is summarized in point 1 -- in particular, the ambiguities around orientation equivariance and the use of oriented operators built from the incidence matrices are what cause me to suggest this paper be rejected. If the authors are to focus on either of the two points in order to change my mind on this paper, it should be the first one.\n\n1. There are some details missing regarding the type of data being handled. In particular, the incidence matrices are not defined in a way sufficient for the discussion following in the paper. Normally, the incidence matrices have values of +-1 depending on a chosen reference orientation (usually given by some ordering of the nodes). Coupled to this, the signs of the features on the simplices are determined relative to the same reference orientation -- this gives meaning to the notion of orientation equivariance. Without discussing these things, orientation equivariance is not a meaningful concept within the context of the paper. \n\na. This calls into question the validity of the example in Section 4.1. You say that all simplices are given a feature value given by some scalar $a$ -- yet, the matrices acting on these feature vectors/matrices have an orientation associated to them. It seems as if you are using an *oriented operator* to act on *unoriented features*. Property 1 in this example is thus difficult to claim, as the property of orientation equivariance is one describing the action of *oriented operators* acting on *oriented features*, and how the choice of orientation to begin with is irrelevant to the computation. \n\nb. Furthermore, this problem yields a comparison for isomorphism testing incorrect, as the erroneous imposition of differently-oriented features relative to the chosen orientations could be used by SaNN to yield a \"false negative,\" i.e., saying that two isomorphic complexes are different. \n\nc. A more minor comment in this direction comes from the **Insights** section of Section 5.1. It is not correct to say that \"the superior performance of SaNN also proves the orientation equivariance of SaNN experimentally.\" Orientation equivariance is a simple mathematical property, and does not guarantee good performance, nor are all performant architectures on a given dataset orientation equivariant. These properties are possibly linked, but the claim that one proves the other in some way is not justified. \n\nd. Moreover, based on my reading of the appendix, many of their experimental setups for tasks other than trajectory prediction use \"unoriented data\" by simply assigning scalar values to high-order simplices, which is again incompatible with the use of oriented operators. Perhaps something in the implementation of SaNN in these examples does not use oriented operators such as the incidence matrices, but this is not clear to me. \n\nPlease either justify, clarify, or revise the paper's discussion regarding orientation equivariance.\n\n2. Related to the above point, the claims in Section 4.2 seem reasonable at first glance, but are not explained well enough. Permutation equivariance is easily seen to hold, so is not much of a concern. Orientation equivariance is subject to the problems noted above, so more clarification on the type of simplicial features and relevant operators needs to be made. That is not to say that the result proved in the appendix is wrong, but it needs to be clarified in order to be understood in a way that acts on oriented features. Simplicial awareness is more subtle than the other two, based on the definition from (Roddenberry et. al., 2021). For instance, some of the existing convolutional-type SNNs in the literature fail to satisfy simplicial awareness if they are implemented without nonlinear activation functions, due to the fact that the square of the (co)boundary operator is the zero operator. Perhaps it is the case that the assumptions of Theorem 4.2 are sufficient to exclude such methods, but a clearer connection is needed. It would be very helpful for the authors to briefly survey some of the methods they compare to, and clarify whether Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 apply or don't apply to them.\n\n---\n\nThank you for addressing my questions -- I have raised my suggested score."

Even though in the introduction we mentioned about orientations of higher-order simplices as \u201cHigher-order simplices are usually oriented, ensuring a consistent node arrangement within each simplex, facilitating tasks like determining information flow directions along the edges.\u201d, we did not formally define the orientations of features on the simplicial complex in relation to the reference node ordering. Therefore, we have now specified in the revised manuscript that signs of features on simplices are determined based on the reference node arrangement within each simplex. Additionally, when features are unoriented, we clarify that there is no need for a reference orientation of simplices. In such cases, we consider unoriented incidence matrices.\n\nTo this end, we have incorporated the following points in Section 2 (Background) at appropriate locations:\n\n\"Each simplex has an orientation defined by a standardized vertex order, typically ascending or descending, establishing a standard node arrangement within each simplex.\"\n\n\"The non-zero entries of an oriented incidence matrix $\\mathbf{B}_k$ can be either $+1$ or $-1$, reflecting the relative orientations of the $i$th $(k\u22121)$-simplex and the $j$th $k$-simplex.\"\n\n\"The sign of feature $\\mathbf{X}_k[\\sigma_k]$ is determined based on the reference orientation of $\\sigma_k$.\"\n\n\"For unoriented features, there is no need for a reference orientation of simplices. In such cases, we consider unoriented incidence matrices. Specifically, the $(i, j)$th entry of an unoriented incidence matrix  $\\mathbf{B}_k$ is $1$ if the $i$th $(k\u22121)$-simplex is a boundary simplex of the $j$th $k$-simplex, and $0$ otherwise.\"\n\nWe believe that these revisions will enhance the comprehension of the orientation equivariance concept within our paper."

                        "value": "We appreciate your feedback regarding the inclusion of precomputation times in our overall computation assessment. While we agree that precomputation is indeed part of the overall process, it generally constitutes a relatively insignificant portion compared to the cumulative time spent on training and testing. \n\nIt is important to note that our method requires precomputation of features just once before the training begins. On the other hand, conventional SNNs require this computation for every layer, where the number of layers correspond to the neighborhood depth from which features are aggregated, and for each epoch and across all orders of simplices. In Appendix B, we do provide a theoretical comparison of overall computational complexities of SaNN and the existing SNN models. The overall time complexity of the existing SNN models is about $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T\\left(\\left(2 N_k^2 D_k+N_k N_{k-1} D_{k-1}+N_k N_{k+1} D_{k+1}\\right)+\\left(3 N_k D_k^2+N_k D_{k-1}^2+N_k D_{k+1}^2\\right)\\right)\\right)$, which is dominated by the first term containing $2 N_k^2 D_k, N_k N_{k-1} D_{k-1}$, and $N_k N_{k+1} D_{k+1}$, corresponding to feature aggregation in every layer. Since feature aggregation happens only once before training as a pecomputation step, an SaNN model capturing information from $0, \\ldots, T$-hop neighborhood of $k$-simplices has a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T\\left(3 N_k D_k^2+N_k D_{k-1}^2+N_k D_{k+1}^2\\right)\\right)$, which is negligibly small when compared to the computational complexity of the existing SNN models. \n\nWe acknowledge that the time savings during inference may not be as pronounced as those during training, but we assert that the substantial enhancements during the training phase are quite significant, given that training time is the primary contributor to overall computation time, which is the sum of precomputation time, training time and inference time. \nNonetheless, in response to your suggestion, we have incorporated precomputation times into our analysis   to provide a more comprehensive view of our method's performance. We present here the precomputation and per epoch training time values of SaNN and the per epoch training time values of baseline SNN models for the three tasks at hand. The first terms in the runtime values of SaNN correspond to the precomputation times and the second terms to the per epoch training times.\n\nTrajectory prediction:\n| Dataset | Ocean | Synthetic | Planar | Mesh |\n|---------|-------|-----------|--------|------|\n| ScoNe   | 0.4   | 3.2       | 30.2   | 18.9 |\n| SCNN    | 1.9   | 4.2       | 36.3   | 29.8 |\n| SaNN    | 0.01,0.1 | 0.06,2.5 | 1.22,26.8 | 0.39,8.1 |\n\n\nSimplicial closure prediction:\n| Dataset      | Enron   | High-school | Primary-school | NDC-classes | Math-sx     |\n|--------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| MPSN         | 255     | 413         | 3499           | -           | -           |\n| SCNN         | 17      | 401         | 1891           | -           | -           |\n| SaNN         | 0.01, 3 | 0.05, 112   | 0.76, 916      | 0.26, 13    | 95.91, 52883|\n\nGraph classification:\n| Dataset  | Proteins | NCI1 | IMDB-B | Reddit-B | Reddit-M |\n|----------|----------|------|--------|----------|----------|\n| MPSN     | 33       | 292  | 46     | 242      | 1119     |\n| SaNN     | 3.6, 0.4 | 6, 58| 4, 8   | 6, 45    | 34, 104  |\n\n\nThe values provided represent the training time per epoch. Out-of-memory results are indicated by \u2212. The total training time for SaNN is calculated as follows:\nTotal training time = Precomputation time + (Number of epochs * Training time per epoch). This total is substantially less than the precomputation times. Furthermore, it is also worth noting that for any neural network model, the larger computational burden lies in the training phase rather than the inference phase. In our study, we have demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that our training times are significantly reduced compared to other models. Therefore, the overall computational efficiency of our method remains superior."

The authors theoretically demonstrate that under certain conditions, SaNNs are better discriminators of non-isomorphic graphs than the WL and SWL test. Empirically, SaNNs are shown to perform competitively against other SNNs and GNNs on tasks such as trajectory prediction, simplicial closure prediction, and several graph classification tasks over various datasets."

SaNNs inherit several valuable invariance properties of other SNNs including permutation invariance, orientation invariance, and simplicial-awareness. \n\n4.

(See questions.) \n\n2. There do not appear to be any results describing the pre-computation time which should be included in any run-time comparisons which I imagine should scale near-exponentially with graph size and order of simplices considered. \n\n3. SaNNs are often not outright the winner in terms of prediction accuracies for the tasks displayed in Tables 1 and 3. For example, in Table 1, the SaNN is outcompeted by Projection and Scone on 3/4 of the datasets and the run-time savings of SaNN are not significant enough to justify usage of the SaNN. In Table 3, SaNN is not the leader in 4/5 of the datasets and it is not even the fastest. On the other hand, the time savings against MPSN are quite significant, but since many practitioners of graph learning expect training to take significant amounts of time, accuracy is the topmost priority, so there wouldn't be a strong enough justification to go with a SaNN."

Although the MLPs will be injective, appealing to the Universal Approximation Theorem to declare that $g_k$ can be injectively-approximated is probably not practical. \n\n2. I may have missed this but are pre-computation times explicitly indicated in the results?"

The first terms in the runtime values of SaNN correspond to the precomputation times and the second terms to the per epoch training times.\nTrajectory prediction:\n| Dataset | Ocean | Synthetic | Planar | Mesh |\n|---------|-------|-----------|--------|------|\n| ScoNe   | 0.4   | 3.2       | 30.2   | 18.9 |\n| SCNN    | 1.9   | 4.2       | 36.3   | 29.8 |\n| SaNN    | 0.01,0.1 | 0.06,2.5 | 1.22,26.8 | 0.39,8.1 |\n\nSimplicial closure prediction:\n| Dataset      | Enron   | High-school | Primary-school | NDC-classes | Math-sx     |\n|--------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n| MPSN         | 255     | 413         | 3499           | -           | -           |\n| SCNN         | 17      | 401         | 1891           | -           | -           |\n| SaNN         | 0.01, 3 | 0.05, 112   | 0.76, 916      | 0.26, 13    | 95.91, 52883|\n\nGraph classification:\n| Dataset  | Proteins | NCI1 | IMDB-B | Reddit-B | Reddit-M |\n|----------|----------|------|--------|----------|----------|\n| MPSN     | 33       | 292  | 46     | 242      | 1119     |\n| SaNN     | 3.6, 0.4 | 6, 58| 4, 8   | 6, 45    | 34, 104  |\n\nThe values provided represent the training time per epoch. Out-of-memory results are indicated by \u2212. The total training time for SaNN is calculated as follows:\nTotal training time = Precomputation time + (Number of epochs * Training time per epoch). This total is substantially less than the precomputation times."

The central idea is that of using injective functions for aggregating simplicial features, as it ensures that the embeddings are unique. The simplicial features are aggregated over upper, lower, boundary and co-boundary adjacencies. The paper provides precise definitions and theorems and statements on the properties of the networks. The proofs are summarized in the main body and provided in full detail in the appendices. The method is further experimentally validated and shows that the proposed model (SaNN) is both efficients (significantly faster than any of the other baselines) and effective (performance within the uncertainty intervals on accurcies, or above the baselines)."

I find talking and reading about simplicial complex often a messy business given all the types of simplices and adjacencies, and the abstract notion in the first place. It is clear that the authors though well about how to present the math. This includes proper use of figures.\n2. The goal of the paper itself -efficiency whilst not compromising on expressivity- is relevant and important, and it is great to see the authors succeeding in reaching this goal.\n3. I appreciate the summary of the proofs after the formal statements.\n4. Next to a sound theoretical exposition, the experiments are thorough as well and include many ablation studies that are used to distill insightful take home messages."

In the end we have equation 8, but it describes a representation for each of the $N$ sets of $k$-simplices, each consisting of the $N_k$ simplices. It is unclear how to distill a global prediction out of all these representations, as would be needed for e.g. the classification tasks. Details on how the architectural design for each of the benchmarks is missing."

On several occasions the notion of \"non-deep baselines\" is used. What is meant by this. Could you clarify what non-deep means here, which methods are these?\n\n3. In section 2 when presenting the symbols it is mentioned that $k=1,2,\\dots,N+1$. Does $k$ always run up all the way to $N+1$?\n\n4. In section 4. The sentence that starts with \"The theorem implies that any arbitrary ...\" is extremely long and hard to comprehend. I suggest to split it 2 or 3 sentence to improve readability.\n\n5. Just above property 1 it is mentioned \"other commonly used sum, mean, or max read-out functions are not injective\" I am not fully sure I understand it correctly. The paragraph above explains that sum aggregation is the best injective aggregator, in contrast to mean aggregation. I think the statement that I just quoted is about aggregating over the different $\\mathbf{Y}$'s? Perhaps this can be clarified.\n\n6. In the tables: since colors red and blue are used you might as well color the text in the caption as well. I.e. \"The {\\color{red}first} and {\\color{blue}second} best performances ...\"\n\n7. The insights section says \"The deep models are observed to perform exceptionally better than logistic regression\", where do I see this? Logistic regression taking what as input? Could this be clarified.\n\nThank you for considering my comments and questions."
